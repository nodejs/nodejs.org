# Path Validation Vulnerability _(Updated 29-September-2017 - CVE assigned)_

The Node.js project released a new version of 8.x this week which incorporates
a security fix.

# Impact

Version 8.5.0 of Node.js is vulnerable.
4.x and 6.x versions are **NOT** vulnerable.

# Downloads
[Node.js 8 (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.6.0/)

# Node.js-specific security flaws

Node.js version 8.5.0 included a change which caused a security vulnerability
in the checks on paths made by some community modules. As a result, an
attacker may be able to access file system paths other than those intended.

This problem was resolved within Node.js by partially reverting
https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/b98e8d995efb426bbdee56ce503017bdcbbc6332.

A CVE has been assigned as [CVE-2017-14849](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-14849)
