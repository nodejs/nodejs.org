# Trademark Policy

The Node.js trademarks, service marks, and graphics marks are symbols of the quality, performance, and ease of use that people have come to associate with the Node.js software and project. To ensure that the Node.js marks continue to symbolize these qualities, we must ensure that the marks are only used in ways that do not mislead people or cause them to confuse Node.js with other software of lower quality. If we don’t ensure the marks are used in this way, it cannot only confuse users, it can make it impossible to use the mark to protect against people who maliciously exploit the mark in the future. The primary goal of this policy is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to the Node.js mark, so that the community and users of Node.js are always protected in the future.

At the same time, we’d like community members to feel comfortable spreading the word about Node.js and participating in the Node.js community. Keeping that goal in mind, we’ve tried to make the policy as flexible and easy to understand as legally possible.

Please read the [full policy](/static/documents/trademark-policy.pdf). If you have any questions don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:trademark@nodejs.org).

Guidelines for the visual display of the Node.js mark are described in the [Visual Guidelines](/static/documents/foundation-visual-guidelines.pdf).
