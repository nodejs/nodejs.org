### Continued Growth of The Node.js Platform and Node.js Foundation

The Node.js Foundation announced progress with efforts to make Node.js VM-neutral -- more information on this news can be found on the Node.js Foundation Medium blog. This morning, the Foundation announced it would oversee the Node.js Security Project to further improve stability for enterprises. More information here.

[NodeSource](https://nodesource.com/) announced [NodeSource Certified Modules™](https://certified.nodesource.com/) to bring security and trust to untrusted, third-party JavaScript. With [NodeSource Certified Modules](https://certified.nodesource.com/), consumers of the npm ecosystem can now rely on NodeSource as a secure, trusted and verifiable source. [Learn more here](https://nodesource.com/blog/announcing-nodesource-certified-modules-for-node-js). The team is also demoing its latest [N|Solid: N|Solid v2.0](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid).
