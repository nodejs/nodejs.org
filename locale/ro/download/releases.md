It used to be stored as hex value in earlier versions, but is now represented as an integer."

### io.js & Node.js
Releases 1.x through 3.x were called "io.js" as they were part of the io.js fork. As of Node.js 4.0.0 the former release lines of io.js converged with Node.js 0.12.x into unified Node.js releases.
