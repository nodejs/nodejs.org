# About Docs

It's important for Node.js to provide documentation to its users, but documentation means different things to different people. Here on nodejs.org you will find three types of documentation, reference documentation, ES6 features and frequently asked questions.

Our [API reference documentation](/api/) is meant to provide detailed version information about a given method or pattern in Node.js. From this documentation you should be able to identify what input a method has, the return value of that method, and what if any errors may be related to method. You should also be able to identify which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.

        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.12.x/api/">Node.js 0.12.x</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v0.10.x/api/">Node.js 0.10.x</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/">all versions</a></li>
    </ul>

The [ES6 section](/en/docs/es6/) describes the three different features groups and which one are enabled by default in Node.js. It lists out all the different features enabled by default alongside explanatory links. Also shows how to find the exact version of V8 a Node.js release has.

Our [FAQ](/en/docs/faq/) shows how everyone can contribute to Node.js, our code of conduct and governance model. How to get in touch on github and IRC and helping out triaging issues.

All of this documentation is meant to only highlight the builtin core modules provided by Node, and not to highlight the module and collection of modules found in the community. Node.js doesn't want to be in the business of picking winners or losers, so to avoid the appearance of favoritism we only discuss our APIs.
