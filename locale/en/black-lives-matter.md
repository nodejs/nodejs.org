White supremacy and police brutality are global problems. Every Black life
lost to police murder globally matters and mattered. The above list
contains the names of Black people murdered by police brutality in the
U.S. since 2009. This is because the U.S. is the origin of the Black Lives
Matter movement and currently the heart of the resistance.

## Our Commitment

It would be wrong for us to ignore the unearned privilege that exists in
Node.js. Much of the project leadership is white, and a majority are men.
We are and have been systematically complicit in perpetuating the issues
that led us to where we are. We can't change how we've built out the
project's leadership to date, but we can change how we build it moving
forward.

We are dedicated to being a part of the solution. We will actively center
the Black community and uplift Black voices. We will share projects
founded and built by Black community members. We will hold ourselves
accountable, fulfill our promises, and make changes as needed. While it is
our responsibility to hold ourselves accountable, we welcome your help. We
invite you to share ways that we can do better. Email
[blacklivesmatter@nodejs.org](mailto:blacklivesmatter@nodejs.org)
or reach out to any of our project leaders.

<section id="here-for-you">

To Black folks looking for access: We're here for you.

To Black people looking for amplification: We're here for you.

To Black members of our community seeking collaboration: We're here for
you.

</section>

The responsibility to dismantle white supremacy does not fall on the Black
community. It falls on the rest of us.

## Taking Action

We will work with any Black community member who wishes to contribute to
Node.js. Please contact us at [blacklivesmatter@nodejs.org](mailto:blacklivesmatter@nodejs.org)
or [@nodejs](https://twitter.com/nodejs) on Twitter with any questions.

Moving forward we plan to offer ongoing support, mentorship, and sponsorship to
help those from the Black community get involved in our project. We will
also be analyzing our existing processes and governance to see what changes
we can make to make sure our project is the kind of environment that the
Black community wants to participate in.
