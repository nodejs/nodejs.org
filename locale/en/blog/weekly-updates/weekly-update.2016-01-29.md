### Node.js News

The Node.js project will be releasing new versions across all of its active release lines early next week (possibly sooner, pending full impact assessment) to incorporate upstream patches from OpenSSL and some additional low-severity fixes relating to HTTP handling. Please read on for full details.

See https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-and-low-severity-fixes-jan-2016/ for more information.

### OpenSSL Impact Assessment

OpenSSL versions 1.0.1r and 1.0.21 have been released, the announcement can be found here: https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-January/000061.html

Our team has made an assessment of the impact of the disclosed defects and concluded that there is no urgency in releasing patched versions of Node.js in response to this release. Therefore, we will be proceeding as planned and attempt to release new versions of each of our active release lines on or after
**Monday the 1st of February, 11pm UTC** _(Monday the 1st of February, 3pm Pacific Time)_. Please note that this is simply an approximation of release timing. Please tune in to **nodejs-sec** (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nodejs-sec) where we will announce the availability of releases.
