### Summary

The OpenSSL Security releases of September 10th, 2019 do not affect Node.js.

### Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt) is:

* ECDSA remote timing attack (CVE-2019-1547)
  Not affected. Node supports only named curves for ECDSA signing.

* Fork Protection (CVE-2019-1549)
  Not affected. Node.js always call `exec()` after `fork()` so will not
  duplicate the PRNG state in the forked process.

* Padding Oracle in `PKCS7_dataDecode` and `CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey` (CVE-2019-1563)
  Not affected. Node does not support PCKS7 and CMS.

Given this assessment, the OpenSSL updates will be treated as non-security
patch updates, and will come out in the regularly scheduled updates to
supported release lines.
