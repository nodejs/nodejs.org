# Summary  

The Node.js project will release new versions of all supported release lines on or shortly after Tuesday December 17, 2019 UTC. For versions 8, 10, and 12 the only update to the runtime in these releases will be an updated version of npm addressing the vulnerability announced in https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli. Version 13, while still being a security release, will include all commits that were scheduled to be included in the originally scheduled release.

In the meantime, users should update to npm 6.13.4 by following the instructions provided in the npm advisory. As a general rule, avoid running npm in production environments.
