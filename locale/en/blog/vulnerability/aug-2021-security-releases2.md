Updates are now available for v14.x, and v12.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

### npm 6 update - node-tar

There are vulnerabilities in the node-tar which
are related to the initial reports and subsequent remediation of node-tar
vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw)
and [CVE-2021-32804](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9).
Subsequent internal security review of node-tar and additional external bounty
reports have resulted in the following further CVEs being remediated in node-tar:

* [CVE-2021-37701](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc)
* [CVE-2021-37712](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p)
* [CVE-2021-37713](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh)

Impacts:
* All versions of the 14.x, and 12.x releases lines

**Note**: [CVE-2021-39134](https://github.com/npm/arborist/security/advisories/GHSA-2h3h-q99f-3fhc) and [CVE-2021-39135](https://github.com/npm/arborist/security/advisories/GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2) previously mentioned in this annoucement do not apply to Node.js 12 and 14 as npm@6 does not depend on the `@npm/arborist` module. These vulnerabilities applied to Node.js 16 and have been fixed via the npm 7.21.0 update which was shipped in [Node.js v16.8.0 (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.8.0/).
