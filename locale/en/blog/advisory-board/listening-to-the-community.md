We assembled the Node.js Advisory Board (AB) to listen to the community and
make the necessary changes to have a unified direction for Node.js, a
passionate group of developers, a vibrant ecosystem of product and service
providers, and a satisfied user base. Over the last month we have made great
progress on an open governance model, API standards, IP management, and
transparency to ensure the project is community-driven. These efforts
explicitly target helping resolve conflicts and with the goal of moving the
community forward together. It is important that we understand voices of
dissent and frustration and work together to build the greater ecosystem. We
are committed to this goal.

Node.js remains the trusted platform that users rely on for creative projects
and to drive business goals. The v0.12 release will ship shortly and the
project team is already engaged in discussions about the next release.
