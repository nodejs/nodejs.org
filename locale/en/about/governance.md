# Project Governance

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Node.js project follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model.

## Collaborators

The [nodejs/node][] core GitHub repository is maintained by the Collaborators
who are added by the Technical Steering Committee ([TSC][]) on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators
and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are identified by the
TSC and their nomination is discussed with the existing Collaborators.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project's [README.md][].

A guide for Collaborators is maintained at [COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md][].

## Top Level Committees

The project is governed jointly by the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)][]
which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project, and the
[Community Committee (CommComm)][] which is responsible for guiding and
extending the Node.js community.
