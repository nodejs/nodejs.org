# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Node.js, there are multiple ways and places you can contribute and we're here to help facilitate that.

## Reporting an Issue

If you have found what you believe to be an issue with Node.js please do not hesistate to file an issue on the GitHub project. When filing your issue please make sure you can express the issue with a reproducible test case, and that test case should not include any external dependencies. That is to say, the test case can be executed without anything more than Node.js itself.

When reporting an issue we also need as much information about your environment that you can include. We never know what information will be pertinent when trying narrow down the issue. Please include at least the following information:

* Version of Node
* Platform you're running on (OS X, SunOS, Linux, Windows)
* Architecture you're running on (32bit or 64bit and x86 or ARM)

The Node.js project is currently managed across a number of separate Github repositories, each with their own separate issues database. If possible, please direct any issues you are reporting to the appropriate repository but don't worry if things happen to get put in the wrong place, the community of contributors will be more than happy to help get you pointed in the right direction.

* To report issues specific to Node.js, please use [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* To report issues specific to this website, please use [nodejs/nodejs.org](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues)

## Code contributions

If you'd like to fix bugs or add a new feature to Node.js, please make sure you consult the [Node.js Development Policy](https://github.com/nodejs/dev-policy).

Before any contribution can be accepted and be part of the project, it needs to be reviewed by existing collaborators in accordance to the guidelines established by the [Node.js Development Policy](https://github.com/nodejs/dev-policy).

## Becoming a collaborator

By becoming a collaborator, contributors can have even more impact on the project. They can help other contributors by reviewing their contributions, triage issues and take an even bigger part in shaping the project's future. The Node.js project is always looking for people who are interested in becoming collaborators.
