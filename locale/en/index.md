Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on [Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine](https://developers.google.com/v8/).
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open
source libraries in the world.
