# Code + Learn

Code & Learn events allow you to get started (or go further) with Node.js core contributions. Experienced contributors help guide you through your first (or second or third or fourth) commit to Node.js core. They also are available to provide impromptu guided tours through specific areas of Node.js core source code.
