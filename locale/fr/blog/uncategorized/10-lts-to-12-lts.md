With the transition of Node.js 12 from Current into LTS, a suite of new features are now available inside Node.js LTS release lines!

In each release's changelog, we capture notable changes. But going through over two dozen individual release notes to find those can be a bit daunting.

As such, I've pulled together **all release notes** from every release from Node.js 11.0.0 to 12.12.0 and included an even higher level "Best of the Best: Most Notable Changes" section that allows you to see what some of the biggest changes are between Node.js v10.x LTS at launch and Node.js v12.x LTS at launch.

### Notable Changes in Node.js 11.3.0 (Security Release)

Fixes for the following CVEs are included in this release:

* Node.js: Denial of Service with large HTTP headers (CVE-2018-12121)
* Node.js: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service (CVE-2018-12122 / Node.js)
* Node.js: Hostname spoofing in URL parser for javascript protocol (CVE-2018-12123)
* OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in DSA signature generation (CVE-2018-0734)
* OpenSSL: Timing vulnerability in ECDSA signature generation (CVE-2019-0735)

* **deps**: Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.0j, fixing CVE-2018-0734 and CVE-2019-0735

### Notable Changes in Node.js 12.1.0

* **intl**:
  * Update ICU to 64.2. This adds support for Japanese Era (Reiwa) (Ujjwal Sharma) [#27361](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27361).
  * Fixes a bug in ICU that affected Node.js 12.0.0 in the case where `new Date().toLocaleString()` was called with a non-default locale (Steven R. Loomis) [#27415](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27415).
* **C++ API**:
  * Added an overload `EmitAsyncDestroy` that can be used during garbage collection (Anna Henningsen) [#27255](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27255).

### Notable Changes in Node.js 12.2.0

* **deps**:
  * Updated llhttp to 1.1.3. This fixes a bug that made Node.js' HTTP parser
    refuse any request URL that contained the "|" (vertical bar) character (Fedor Indutny) [#27595](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27595).
* **tls**:
  * Added an `enableTrace()` method to `TLSSocket` and an `enableTrace` option
    to `tls.createServer()`. When enabled, TSL packet trace information is
    written to `stderr`. This can be used to debug TLS connection problems (cjihrig) [#27497](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27497), (Sam Roberts) [#27376](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27376).
* **cli**:
  * Added a `--trace-tls` command-line flag that enables tracing of TLS
    connections without the need to modify existing application code (cjihrig) [#27497](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27497).
  * Added a `--cpu-prof-interval` command-line flag. It can be used to specify
    the sampling interval for the CPU profiles generated by `--cpu-prof` (Joyee Cheung) [#27535](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27535).
* **module**:
  * Added the `createRequire()` method. It allows to create a require function
    from a file URL object, a file URL string or an absolute path string. The
    existing `createRequireFromPath()` method is now deprecated (Myles Borins) [#27405](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27405).
  * Throw on `require('./path.mjs')`. This is technically a breaking change that
    should have landed with Node.js 12.0.0. It is necessary to have this to keep
    the possibility for a future minor version to load ES Modules with the
    require function (Myles Borins) [#27417](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27417).
* **repl**:
  * The REPL now supports multi-line statements using `BigInt` literals as well
    as public and private class fields and methods (Ruben Bridgewater) [#27400](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27400).
  * The REPL now supports tab autocompletion of file paths with `fs` methods (Anto Aravinth) [#26648](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/26648).
* **meta**:
  * Added [Christian Clauss](https://github.com/cclauss) to collaborators [#27554](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27554).

### Notable Changes in Node.js 12.4.0

* **doc**:
  * The JSON variant of the API documentation is no longer experimental (Rich Trott) [#27842](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27842).
* **esm**:
  * JSON module support is always enabled under `--experimental-modules`. The
    `--experimental-json-modules` flag has been removed (Myles Borins) [#27752](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27752).
* **http,http2**:
  * A new flag has been added for overriding the default HTTP server socket
    timeout (which is two minutes). Pass `--http-server-default-timeout=milliseconds`
    or `--http-server-default-timeout=0` to respectively change or disable the timeout.
    Starting with Node.js 13.0.0, the timeout will be disabled by default (Ali Ijaz Sheikh) [#27704](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27704).
* **inspector**:
  * Added an experimental `--heap-prof` flag to start the V8 heap profiler
    on startup and write the heap profile to disk before exit (Joyee Cheung) [#27596](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27596).
* **stream**:
  * The `readable.unshift()` method now correctly converts strings to buffers.
    Additionally, a new optional argument is accepted to specify the string's
    encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'` (Marcos Casagrande) [#27194](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27194).
* **v8**:
  * The object returned by `v8.getHeapStatistics()` has two new properties:
    `number_of_native_contexts` and `number_of_detached_contexts` (Yuriy Vasiyarov) [#27933](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27933).

    * Long strings will not be split at 80 characters anymore. Instead they will
      be split on new lines [#28055](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28055)
* **worker**:
  * `worker.terminate()` now returns a promise and using the callback is
    deprecated [#28021](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28021)

### Notable Changes in Node.js 12.6.0

* **build**:
  * Experimental support for building Node.js on MIPS architecture is back [#27992](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27992).

    * `uv_fs_copyfile()` now works properly when the source and destination files are the same.
* **process**:
  * A new method, `process.resourceUsage()` was added. It returns resource usage
    for the current process, such as CPU time [#28018](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28018).
* **src**:
  * Fixed an issue related to stdio that could lead to a crash of the process in
    some circumstances [#28490](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28490).
* **stream**:

  * Modify `process.report.getReport()` to return an `Object` instead of a JSON string (Christopher Hiller) [#28630](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28630).
* **src**:
  * Use cgroups to get memory limits. This improves the way we set the memory ceiling for a Node.js process. Previously
    we would use the physical memory size to estimate the necessary V8 heap sizes. The physical memory size
    is not necessarily the correct limit, e.g. if the process is running inside a docker container or is otherwise
    constrained. This change adds the ability to get a memory limit set by linux cgroups, which is used by
    [docker containers to set resource constraints](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/)
    (Kelvin Jin) [#27508](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27508).

### Notable Changes in Node.js 12.8.1

This is a security release.

Node.js, as well as many other implementations of HTTP/2, have been found
vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.
See https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md
for more information.

Vulnerabilities fixed:

* **CVE-2019-9511 “Data Dribble”**: The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9512 “Ping Flood”**: The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9513 “Resource Loop”**: The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9514 “Reset Flood”**: The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9515 “Settings Flood”**: The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9516 “0-Length Headers Leak”**: The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9517 “Internal Data Buffering”**: The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.
* **CVE-2019-9518 “Empty Frames Flood”**: The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google)
