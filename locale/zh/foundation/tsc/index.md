## Collaborators and the Technical Steering Committee

The Node.js project is sponsored by the Node.js Foundation and maintained by
individual Collaborators. The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) membership
consists of key Collaborators who have demonstrated both technical expertise
critical to the ongoing maintenance and evolution of the project and a long
term commitment to driving the project and community forward.

You can read more about how to become a collaborator and a TSC member in [the
contributing section](/en/get-involved/contribute/).

### Current collaborators
