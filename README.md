### Deployment

The Website is automatically deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) through its GitHub App integration when new pushes happen on the `main` branch.

Details regarding the deployment are only accessible to the maintainers of the Website Team due to certain limitations.

The current integration is owned by the OpenJS Foundation and managed by the Website Team.

The full setup is in <https://github.com/nodejs/build/tree/master/ansible/www-standalone> minus secrets and certificates.

The webhook is set up on GitHub for this project and talks to a small Node server on the host, which does the work. See the [github-webhook](https://github.com/rvagg/github-webhook) package for this.
