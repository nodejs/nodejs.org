  migration.

This page provides a list of codemods to help you migrate your code from Node.js v20 to v22.

## `import-assertions-to-attributes`

During the process of TC39 standardization, the `import assert` feature was introduced to allow importing [JSON modules](https://tc39.es/proposal-json-modules/), but during the during the transition to stage 4, the `assert` keyword was replaced with an `with` attribute on the `import` statement.

So in [node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v22.0.0#other-notable-changes), the `import assert` feature was removed and the `with` attribute is required instead.

Also note that the `with` keyword as been introduce in [node.js v18.20](https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v18.20.0#added-support-for-import-attributes) but it was not mandatory until v22.

The source code for this codemod can be found in the [import-assertions-to-attributes directory](https://github.com/nodejs/userland-migrations/tree/main/recipes/import-assertions-to-attributes).

You can find this codemod in the [Codemod Registry](https://app.codemod.com/registry/@nodejs/import-assertions-to-attributes).

```bash
npx codemod run @nodejs/import-assertions-to-attributes
```

### Example:

```js displayName="Before"
import jsonData from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

```js displayName="After"
import jsonData from './data.json' with { type: 'json' };
```
