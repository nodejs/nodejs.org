# Migrate from Chalk to Node.js util styleText

## `chalk-to-util-styletext`

This codemod aims to help you reduce external dependencies by transforming chalk method calls to use the native Node.js styling functionality. It will also handle automatic removal of the [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) package from the package.json.

### Compatible Features:

- Basic colors (red, green, blue, yellow, etc.)
- Bright colors (redBright, greenBright, etc.)
- Background colors (bgRed, bgGreen, etc.)
- Text modifiers (bold, dim, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.)
- Style chaining via array syntax
- Environment variable support (NO_COLOR, NODE_DISABLE_COLORS, FORCE_COLOR)

### Incompatible Features:

- Custom RGB colors (chalk.rgb(), chalk.hex())
- 256-color palette (chalk.ansi256())
- Template literal syntax (chalk...``)
- Advanced modifiers with limited terminal support (overline, blink, etc.)

### Prerequisites:

#### Node.js Version Requirements

- Node.js v20.12.0 or later (for util.styleText)
- `util.styleText` became stable in Node.js v22.13.0 (and v23.5.0)

> If your package currently supports Node.js versions earlier than v20.12.0, you cannot migrate to util.styleText without dropping support for those versions.
> This requires bumping the major version of your package AND updating the engines field in your package.json to require Node.js >= v20.12.0.

### Usage:

The source code for this codemod can be found in the [chalk-to-util-styletext directory](https://github.com/nodejs/userland-migrations/tree/main/recipes/chalk-to-util-styletext).

You can find this codemod in the [Codemod Registry](https://app.codemod.com/registry/@nodejs/chalk-to-util-styletext).

```bash
npx codemod @nodejs/chalk-to-util-styletext
```

### Example:

```js displayName="Before"
import chalk from 'chalk';

console.log(chalk.red('Error message'));

console.log(chalk.red.bold('Important error'));

const red = chalk.red;
console.log(red('Error'));

const boldBlue = chalk.blue.bold;
console.log(boldBlue('Info'));
```

```js displayName="After"
import { styleText } from 'node:util';

console.log(styleText('red', 'Error message'));

console.log(styleText(['red', 'bold'], 'Important error'));

const red = text => styleText('red', text);
console.log(red('Error'));

const boldBlue = text => styleText(['blue', 'bold'], text);
console.log(boldBlue('Info'));
```

## Recognition

We would like to thank the maintainers of [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) for their support of the package over time and for its contributions to the ecosystem.
