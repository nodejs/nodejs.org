## (Update 08-Jan-2026) Security Release postponed to January 13th

Our team has decided to postpone the release to Tuesday, January 13th, 2026.
This additional time will allow us to properly test all backports and re-run CITGM
to ensure the highest quality for our users. Additionally, releasing on Tuesday rather
than Friday helps ensure that security updates are available during regular business
hours across all time zones, particularly for our users in the Asia-Pacific region.

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to deliver a secure and
reliable release. If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to
join us in the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/).

## (Update 07-Jan-2026) Security Release postponed to January 8th

Our team decided to postpone the release to Thursday, January 8th, 2026,
due to complications in the Node.js testing CI.

## (Update 17-Dec-2025) Security Release target January 7th

We have decided to delay the release further to Wednesday, January 7th, 2026. Many of the
downstream projects and users are on holiday break at the end of the year, and the security
release will disclose the vulnerabilities being fixed as soon as the patches are available.
We want to make sure that most users are no longer on holiday when they evaluate whether
they are affected and need to perform time-sensitive upgrades.

## (Update 15-Dec-2025) Security Release target December 18th

The team is still working on a particularly challenging patch, for this reason
the release is being postponed to Thursday, December 18th or shortly after.
