## (Update 17-Dec-2025) Security Release target January 7th

We have decided to delay the release further to Wednesday, January 7th, 2026. Many of the
downstream projects and users are on holiday break at the end of the year, and the security
release will disclose the vulnerabilities being fixed as soon as the patches are available.
We want to make sure that most users are no longer on holiday when they evaluate whether
they are affected and need to perform time-sensitive upgrades.

## (Update 15-Dec-2025) Security Release target December 18th

The team is still working on a particularly challenging patch, for this reason
the release is being postponed to Thursday, December 18th or shortly after.
