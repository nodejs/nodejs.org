## Security releases available

Updates are now available for the 24.x, 22.x, 20.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## Windows Device Names (CON, PRN, AUX) Bypass Path Traversal Protection in path.normalize() (CVE-2025-27210) - (high)

An incomplete fix has been identified for CVE-2025-23084 in Node.js, specifically affecting Windows device names like CON, PRN, and AUX.

This vulnerability affects Windows users of `path.join` API.

Impact:

- This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 20.x, 22.x, 24.x

Thank you, to oblivionsage for reporting this vulnerability and thank you RafaelGSS for fixing it.

## HashDoS in V8 (CVE-2025-27209) - (high)

The V8 release used in Node.js v24.0.0 has changed how string hashes are computed using rapidhash.
This implementation re-introduces the HashDoS vulnerability as an attacker who can control the strings to be hashed can generate
many hash collisions - an attacker can generate collisions even without knowing the hash-seed.

While the V8 team does not classify this as a security vulnerability, the Node.js project considers it one due to its potential
impact in real-world scenarios.

- This vulnerability affects Node.js v24.x users.

Impact:

- This vulnerability affects all users in active release lines: 24.x

Thank you, to sharp_edged for reporting this vulnerability and thank you targos for fixing it.
