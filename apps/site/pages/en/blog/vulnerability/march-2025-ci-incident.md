On March 21st, the Node.js project received a security report regarding our development infrastructure via [our bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs). We immediately restricted access while implementing corrective actions.

The reported issue did not impact the Node.js runtime and there is no risk to users of Node.js. No action by Node.js users is required.

The development infrastructure is expected to be available to the community by April 15 or sooner.

A full report of this incident will be available forthcoming. We appreciate the time investment from our amazing volunteers who assisted in this response.
