# Update on the issuance of CVEs to mark End-of-Life Node.js Versions

**TL;DR:** CVE-2025-23087, CVE-2025-23088, and CVE-2025-23089 issued to
tag EOL versions have been rejected by MITRE.
The Node.js team has, therefore, decided to update previous vulnerability specific
CVEs to cover EOL releases, reflecting their ongoing security risks. This means that
all new CVEs issued will include EOL releases in the applicability until we have specific
information that indicates a CVE does not apply to an EOL release line. The project
does not plan to evaluate CVEs against EOL lines but information provided to the
project may be used to update the applicability if/when it is available.

On January 21, 2025, Node.js released security patches for four active release
lines. At the same time, CVEs were assigned to cover EOL (end-of-life) versions:

* **CVE-2025-23087:** Applies to Node.js v17 and all earlier versions (including v0.x).
* **CVE-2025-23088:** Applies to Node.js v19.
* **CVE-2025-23089:** Applies to Node.js v21.

For more details, refer to the original announcement: [Node.js Vulnerability Announcement](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/upcoming-cve-for-eol-versions).

## Why Node.js Does Not Evaluate EOL Versions

Due to resource constraints, Node.js does not assess security reports for EOL
releases or include them in regular CVE version ranges. With over 20 EOL
versions—each with different dependencies, build processes, and
platform support—comprehensive vulnerability assessments are not feasible.

Limiting reviews to a subset of EOL versions could lead to inaccuracies, as
vulnerabilities may appear differently based on underlying components like OpenSSL.
Thus, the focus remains on actively supported releases.

> "Why did the Node.js project issue a CVE for all EOL releases? Because we
don’t have the resources to evaluate every single past release to know which
are vulnerable. Node.js is run by volunteers. We have sufficient funding to
maintain current releases, but not beyond that. In other words, all past Node.js
releases are vulnerable or will soon be. This CVE highlights that risk for your
organization."

## Purpose of Issuing These CVEs

Security scanners in production environments trigger alerts when an active
Node.js version is flagged as vulnerable, prompting an upgrade. If an EOL
version is not listed as affected, users might mistakenly consider their setup
secure. The Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) noted that outdated
versions, such as Node.js v16 (which, despite being EOL for over a year, still
sees 11 million downloads per month), continue to be widely used.

Assigning CVEs to EOL versions directly communicates the associated security
risks to organizations.

## Recent CVE Updates

Following consultations with the CVE Program, HackerOne, and Node.js, further
updates were made to these CVEs:

* MITRE has tagged the CVEs with "unsupported when assigned" and marked them as "disputed" since they do not pinpoint a specific vulnerability.
* A note has been added indicating that using the CVE List to report an unsupported product is a new approach under review.

Ultimately, the Board decided to **reject** these CVEs. However, this decision
does not determine the long-term stance of the CVE Program on EOL support.
The Board will continue discussing potential solutions for managing EOL versions.

Therefore, the only *viable* solution to reflect the risk of running and EOL
line is to update previous CVEs to cover EOL releases, reflecting
their ongoing security risks. The process is being tracked in
[nodejs/security-wg#1443](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1443).
