We are thrilled to announce the launch of the official Node.js community space on Discord! Over the past few months, in collaboration with the [Reactiflux](https://www.reactiflux.com/) community, we have been working diligently to create a vibrant and engaging space for Node.js enthusiasts. Today, we are excited to invite you to join us on this new platform!

### Why Discord?

[Discord](https://discord.com) has rapidly become a go-to platform for communities to connect and communicate. Many Node.js community members already use Discord to discuss Node.js, seek advice, and share their projects. By establishing an official Node.js Discord server, we aim to centralize these conversations and provide a dedicated space for our community. Additionally, numerous other open-source projects, such as [TypeScript](https://discord.gg/typescript), [Rust](https://discord.gg/rust-lang), and [Kubernetes](https://discord.gg/kubernetes), have successfully built their communities on Discord.

Our Node.js Discord space will be perfect for:

- Hosting livestreams by [Node.js Ambassadors](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-ambassadors) and community members
- Facilitating discussions about Node.js, answering questions, and sharing projects
- Connecting with Node.js maintainers, influencers, and contributors
- Receiving the latest updates on Node.js releases and events hosted by the OpenJS Foundation

And so much more! We can't wait to see how you will utilize this new space.

### The Journey So Far

Our journey began with [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/872). We partnered with the Reactiflux/Nodeiflux community to rebrand their existing Nodeiflux server as the official Node.js Discord server. Over the past few months, we have been preparing the server for everyone to use, and you can follow some of our progress in the issue.

The Nodeiflux server has now been repurposed to serve as the official Node.js Discord server. We are excited to see how our community will thrive in this new environment. The server will be jointly managed by the Node.js project and the Nodeiflux community, with the Node.js Technical Steering Committee (TSC) providing advisory support. The Nodeiflux community will handle the day-to-day administration of the server.

For all intents and purposes, this is an official Node.js space, and we are eager to see how it will grow and evolve.

### How to Join

Joining the Node.js Discord server is easy! Simply visit [https://discord.gg/nodejs](https://discord.gg/nodejs) and become part of our growing community. We can't wait to see you there!

### Looking Ahead

We are eager to see how our community will grow and interact in this new space. We look forward to hosting events and livestreams in the future. If you have any ideas or feedback, please share them in the #discord-feedback channel on the server.
