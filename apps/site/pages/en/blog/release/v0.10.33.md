This release handles the recent POODLE vulnerability by disabling SSLv2/SSLv3
by default for the most predominate uses of TLS in Node.js.

It took longer than expected to get this release accomplished in a way that
would provide appropriate default security settings, while minimizing the
surface area for the behavior change we were introducing. It was also important
that we validated that our changes were being applied in the variety of
configurations we support in our APIs.

With this release, we are confident that the only behavior change is that of
the default allowed protocols do not include SSLv2 or SSLv3. Though you are
still able to programatically consume those protocols if necessary.

Included is the documentation that you can find at
https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_protocol_support that describes how this
works going forward for client and server implementations.

Node.js is compiled with SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocol support by default, but these
protocols are **disabled**. They are considered insecure and could be easily
compromised as was shown by [CVE-2014-3566][]. However, in some situations, it
may cause problems with legacy clients/servers (such as Internet Explorer 6).
If you wish to enable SSLv2 or SSLv3, run node with the `--enable-ssl2` or
`--enable-ssl3` flag respectively. In future versions of Node.js SSLv2 and
SSLv3 will not be compiled in by default.

There is a way to force node into using SSLv3 or SSLv2 only mode by explicitly
specifying `secureProtocol` to `'SSLv3_method'` or `'SSLv2_method'`.

The default protocol method Node.js uses is `SSLv23_method` which would be more
accurately named `AutoNegotiate_method`. This method will try and negotiate
from the highest level down to whatever the client supports. To provide a
secure default, Node.js (since v0.10.33) explicitly disables the use of SSLv3
and SSLv2 by setting the `secureOptions` to be
`SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2` (again, unless you have passed
`--enable-ssl3`, or `--enable-ssl2`, or `SSLv3_method` as `secureProtocol`).

If you have set `securityOptions` to anything, we will not override your
options.

The ramifications of this behavior change:

- If your application is behaving as a secure server, clients who are `SSLv3`
  only will now not be able to appropriately negotiate a connection and will be
  refused. In this case your server will emit a `clientError` event. The error
  message will include `'wrong version number'`.
- If your application is behaving as a secure client and communicating with a
  server that doesn't support methods more secure than SSLv3 then your connection
  won't be able to negotiate and will fail. In this case your client will emit a
  an `error` event. The error message will include `'wrong version number'`.

2014.10.20, Version 0.10.33 (Stable)

- openssl: Update to 1.0.1j (Addressing multiple CVEs)

- uv: Update to v0.10.29

- child_process: properly support optional args (cjihrig)

- crypto: Disable autonegotiation for SSLv2/3 by default (Fedor Indutny,
  Timothy J Fontaine, Alexis Campailla)

This is a behavior change, by default we will not allow the negotiation to
SSLv2 or SSLv3. If you want this behavior, run Node.js with either
`--enable-ssl2` or `--enable-ssl3` respectively.

This does not change the behavior for users specifically requesting
`SSLv2_method` or `SSLv3_method`. While this behavior is not advised, it is
assumed you know what you're doing since you're specifically asking to use
these methods.
