This week office hours are only from 4pm to 6pm. Isaac will be in the Joyent office in SF - everyone else is out of town. Sign up at http://nodeworkup.eventbrite.com/ if you would like to come.

The week after, Thursday May 5th, we will all be at NodeConf in Portland.

Normal office hours resume Thursday May 12th.
