# Security Reporting

For more details on active Security Policies, checkout [this page](https://github.com/nodejs/node/security/policy).

## Reporting a bug in Node.js

Report security bugs in Node.js via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/nodejs).

Normally, your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you'll receive
a more detailed response to your report within 10 days indicating the
next steps in handling your submission. These timelines may extend when
our triage volunteers are away on holiday, particularly at the end of the
year.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep
you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance surrounding the reported
issue.

### Node.js bug bounty program

The Node.js project engages in an official bug bounty program for security
researchers and responsible public disclosures. The program is managed through
the HackerOne platform. See [https://hackerone.com/nodejs](https://hackerone.com/nodejs) for further details.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective
maintainers.

## Disclosure policy

Here is the security disclosure policy for Node.js

- The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This
  person will coordinate the fix and release process. The problem is validated
  against all supported Node.js versions. Once confirmed, a list of all affected
  versions is determined. Code is audited to find any potential similar
  problems. Fixes are prepared for all supported releases.
  These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally
  pending the announcement.

- A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and a CVE (Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEÂ®)) is requested for the vulnerability.

- On the embargo date, a copy of the announcement is sent to the Node.js
  security mailing list. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new
  builds are deployed to nodejs.org. Within 6 hours of the mailing list being
  notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the Node.js blog.

- Typically, the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time the CVE is
  issued. However, this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
  difficulty in applying a fix.

- This process can take some time, especially when we need to coordinate with
  maintainers of other projects. We will try to handle the bug as quickly as
  possible; however, we must follow the release process above to ensure that we
  handle disclosure consistently.

## Receiving security updates

Security notifications will be distributed via the following methods.

- [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/nodejs-sec)
- [Node.js Blog](/blog)

## Comments on this policy

The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Best Practices badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge) is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify how they follow each best practice. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and as a result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
