# Node.js Releases

<EOLAlertBox />

Major Node.js versions enter _Current_ release status for six months, which gives library authors time to add support for them.
After six months, odd-numbered releases (9, 11, etc.) become unsupported, and even-numbered releases (10, 12, etc.) move to _Active LTS_ status and are ready for general use.
_LTS_ release status is "long-term support", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months.
Production applications should only use _Active LTS_ or _Maintenance LTS_ releases.

## Official vs. Community Installation Methods

The Node.js website provides several non-interactive installation methods, including command-line interfaces (CLIs), operating system (OS) package managers (e.g., `brew`), and Node.js version managers (e.g., `nvm`).

To highlight and promote community contributions, the Node.js project introduced a revised Downloads page categorizing installation methods as either “Official” or “Community.” This provides users with increased flexibility and choice. To ensure clarity, we’ve defined criteria for each category.

### Official Installation Methods

Installation methods designated as “Official” must meet the following requirements:

| Requirements (Official Installation Methods)                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Node.js releases must be available simultaneously with the official release.                                                 |
| Project maintainers must have a close relationship with the Node.js project, including direct communication channels.            |
| Installation method must download official binaries bundled by the Node.js project.                                              |
| Installation method must not build from source when pre-built binaries are available, nor should it alter the official binaries. |

### Community Installation Methods

Community installation methods included on the self-service download page (located at /download) must also adhere to a minimum set of criteria:

- **Version Support:** Must support all currently supported, non-End-of-Life (EOL) Node.js versions.
- **OS Compatibility:** Must function on at least one officially supported Operating System (OS).
- **Broad OS Support:** Cannot be limited to a subset of OS distributions or versions.
  - For example, an installation method claiming compatibility with “Windows” must function on “Windows 10”, “Windows 11”, and all their editions (including server versions).
  - Similarly, an installation method claiming compatibility with “Linux” must be installable on all major Linux distributions, not just a specific subset. It cannot rely on distribution-specific package managers like `apt` or `dnf`.
- **Free and Open Source:** Must be free to use and open source, must not be sold as a commercial product, and must not be a paid service.
