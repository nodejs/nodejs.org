# Partners & Supporters

The Node.js community is enriched by a vibrant network of partners who contribute
in diverse ways. Through these collaborations, we maintain our resilient infrastructure,
strengthen security, drive new releases, and sustainably grow our ecosystem.

We are grateful for the support of our partners, who play a crucial role in the success and
continuous development of Node.js.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure partners provide important support for the Node.js project,
providing hardware and machines for our continuous integration and testing processes,
without we can't test and release new versions of Node.js.

## Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP)

Do you run a node.js version on End-of-Life (EOL)? The OpenJS Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP)
is a program that helps organizations to maintain their Node.js applications on EOL versions.
The program provides access to security patches, compliance assistance, and technical support
to help bridge the gap while you plan your upgrade strategy. For more information about
End-Of-Life versions, please visit [End-Of-Life Node.js Releases](/about/eol)

> Using EOL releases through NES should be viewed as a temporary solution, the goal should always
> be to upgrade to actively supported versions.
