## Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP)

Do you run a node.js version on End-of-Life (EOL)? The OpenJS Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP)
is a program that helps organizations to maintain their Node.js applications on EOL versions.
The program provides access to security patches, compliance assistance, and technical support
to help bridge the gap while you plan your upgrade strategy. For more information about
End-Of-Life versions, please visit [End-Of-Life Node.js Releases](/eol)

> Using EOL releases through NES should be viewed as a temporary solution, the goal should always
> be to upgrade to actively supported versions.
