# Node.js File Paths

Every file in the system has a path. On Linux and macOS, a path might look like: `/users/joe/file.txt` while Windows computers are different, and have a structure such as: `C:\users\joe\file.txt`

You need to pay attention when using paths in your applications, as this difference must be taken into account.

You include this module in your files using `const path = require('node:path');` and you can start using its methods.

## Getting information out of a path

Given a path, you can extract information out of it using those methods:

- `dirname`: gets the parent folder of a file
- `basename`: gets the filename part
- `extname`: gets the file extension

### Example

```cjs
const path = require('node:path');

const notes = '/users/joe/notes.txt';

path.dirname(notes); // /users/joe
path.basename(notes); // notes.txt
path.extname(notes); // .txt
```

```mjs
import path from 'node:path';

const notes = '/users/joe/notes.txt';

path.dirname(notes); // /users/joe
path.basename(notes); // notes.txt
path.extname(notes); // .txt
```

You can get the file name without the extension by specifying a second argument to `basename`:

```js
path.basename(notes, path.extname(notes)); // notes
```

## Working with paths

You can join two or more parts of a path by using `path.join()`:

```js
const name = 'joe';
path.join('/', 'users', name, 'notes.txt'); // '/users/joe/notes.txt'
```

You can get the absolute path calculation of a relative path using `path.resolve()`:

```js
path.resolve('joe.txt'); // '/Users/joe/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

In this case Node.js will simply append `/joe.txt` to the current working directory. If you specify a second parameter folder, `resolve` will use the first as a base for the second:

```js
path.resolve('tmp', 'joe.txt'); // '/Users/joe/tmp/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

If the first parameter starts with a slash, that means it's an absolute path:

```js
path.resolve('/etc', 'joe.txt'); // '/etc/joe.txt'
```

`path.normalize()` is another useful function, that will try and calculate the actual path, when it contains relative specifiers like `.` or `..`, or double slashes:

```js
path.normalize('/users/joe/..//test.txt'); // '/users/test.txt'
```

**Neither resolve nor normalize will check if the path exists**. They just calculate a path based on the information they got.
