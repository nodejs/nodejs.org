# Working with file descriptors in Node.js

Before you're able to interact with a file that sits in your filesystem, you must get a file descriptor.

A file descriptor is a reference to an open file, a number (fd) returned by opening the file using the `open()` method offered by the `fs` module. This number (`fd`) uniquely identifies an open file in operating system:

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  // fd is our file descriptor
});
```

```mjs
import fs from 'node:fs';

fs.open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  // fd is our file descriptor
});
```

Notice the `r` we used as the second parameter to the `fs.open()` call.

That flag means we open the file for reading.

**Other flags you'll commonly use are:**

| Flag | Description                                                                                                    | File gets created if it doesn't exist |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| r+   | This flag opens the file for reading and writing                                                               | ❌                                    |
| w+   | This flag opens the file for reading and writing and it also positions the stream at the beginning of the file | ✅                                    |
| a    | This flag opens the file for writing and it also positions the stream at the end of the file                   | ✅                                    |
| a+   | This flag opens the file for reading and writing and it also positions the stream at the end of the file       | ✅                                    |

You can also open the file by using the `fs.openSync` method, which returns the file descriptor, instead of providing it in a callback:

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs');

try {
  const fd = fs.openSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

```mjs
import fs from 'node:fs';

try {
  const fd = fs.openSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err);
}
```

Once you get the file descriptor, in whatever way you choose, you can perform all the operations that require it, like calling `fs.close()` and many other operations that interact with the filesystem.

You can also open the file by using the promise-based `fsPromises.open` method offered by the `fs/promises` module.

The `fs/promises` module is available starting only from Node.js v14. Before v14, after v10, you can use `require('fs').promises` instead. Before v10, after v8, you can use `util.promisify` to convert `fs` methods into promise-based methods.

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');
// Or const fs = require('fs').promises before v14.
async function example() {
  let filehandle;
  try {
    filehandle = await fs.open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
    console.log(filehandle.fd);
    console.log(await filehandle.readFile({ encoding: 'utf8' }));
  } finally {
    if (filehandle) {
      await filehandle.close();
    }
  }
}
example();
```

```mjs
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';
// Or const fs = require('fs').promises before v14.
let filehandle;
try {
  filehandle = await fs.open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
  console.log(filehandle.fd);
  console.log(await filehandle.readFile({ encoding: 'utf8' }));
} finally {
  if (filehandle) {
    await filehandle.close();
  }
}
```

Here is an example of `util.promisify`:

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs');
const util = require('node:util');

async function example() {
  const open = util.promisify(fs.open);
  const fd = await open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
}
example();
```

```mjs
import fs from 'node:fs';
import util from 'node:util';

async function example() {
  const open = util.promisify(fs.open);
  const fd = await open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
}
example();
```
