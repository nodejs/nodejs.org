# How to read environment variables from Node.js

The `process` core module of Node.js provides the `env` property which hosts all the environment variables that were set at the moment the process was started.

The below code runs `app.js` and set `USER_ID` and `USER_KEY`.

```bash
USER_ID=239482 USER_KEY=foobar node app.js
```

That will pass the user `USER_ID` as **239482** and the `USER_KEY` as **foobar**. This is suitable for testing, however for production, you will probably be configuring some bash scripts to export variables.

> Note: `process` does not need to be imported, it is a global object in Node.js.

Here is an example that accesses the `USER_ID` and `USER_KEY` environment variables, which we set in above code.

```js
process.env.USER_ID; // "239482"
process.env.USER_KEY; // "foobar"
```

In the same way you can access any custom environment variable you set.

Node.js 20 introduced **experimental** [support for .env files](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v22.x/docs/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig).

Now, you can use the `--env-file` flag to specify an environment file when running your Node.js application. Here's an example `.env` file and how to access its variables using `process.env`.

```bash
# .env file
PORT=3000
```

In your js file

```js
process.env.PORT; // "3000"
```

Run `app.js` file with environment variables set in `.env` file.

```bash
node --env-file=.env app.js
```

This command loads all the environment variables from the `.env` file, making them available to the application on `process.env`

Also, you can pass multiple `--env-file` arguments. Subsequent files override pre-existing variables defined in previous files.

```bash
node --env-file=.development.env --env-file=.env app.js
```

> Note: if the same variable is defined in the environment and in the file, the value from the environment takes precedence.

In case you want to optionally read from a `.env` file, it's possible to avoid
throwing an error if the file is missing using the `--env-file-if-exists` flag.

```bash
node --env-file-if-exists=.env app.js
```
