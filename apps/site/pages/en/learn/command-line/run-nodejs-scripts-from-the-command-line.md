# Run Node.js scripts from the command line

The usual way to run a Node.js program is to run the globally available `node` command (once you install Node.js) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.

If your main Node.js application file is `app.js`, you can call it by typing:

```bash
node app.js
```

Above, you are explicitly telling the shell to run your script with `node`. You can also embed this information into your JavaScript file with a ["shebang"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) line. The "shebang" is the first line in the file, and tells the OS which interpreter to use for running the script. Below is the first line of JavaScript:

```js
#!/usr/bin/node
```

Above, we are explicitly giving the absolute path of interpreter. Not all operating systems have `node` in the bin folder, but all should have `env`. You can tell the OS to run `env` with node as parameter:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

// your javascript code
```

To use a shebang, your file should have executable permission. You can give `app.js` the executable permission by running:

```bash
chmod u+x app.js
```

While running the command, make sure you are in the same directory which contains the `app.js` file.

## Pass string as argument to `node` instead of file path

To execute a string as argument you can use `-e`, `--eval "script"`. Evaluate the following argument as JavaScript. The modules which are predefined in the REPL can also be used in script.

On Windows, using cmd.exe a single quote will not work correctly because it only recognizes double `"` for quoting. In Powershell or Git bash, both `'` and `"` are usable.

```bash
node -e "console.log(123)"
```

## Restart the application automatically

As of Node.js V16, there is a built-in option to automatically restart the application when a file changes. This is useful for development purposes.
To use this feature, you need to pass the `--watch` flag to Node.js.

```bash
node --watch app.js
```

So when you change the file, the application will restart automatically.
Read the [`--watch` flag documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/cli.html#--watch).

## Run a task with Node.js

Node.js provides a built-in task runner that allows you to execute specific commands defined in your `package.json` file. This can be particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks such as running tests, building your project, or linting your code.

### Using the `--run` flag

The [`--run`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/cli.html#--run) flag allows you to run a specified command from the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file. For example, if you have the following `package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "node --run start -- --watch",
    "test": "node --test"
  }
}
```

You can run the `test` script using the `--run` flag:

```bash
node --run test
```

### Passing arguments to the command

Let's explain the `dev` key in the `scripts` object of the `package.json` file.

The syntax `-- --another-argument` is used to pass arguments to the command. In this case, the `--watch` argument is passed to the `dev` script.

```bash
node --run dev
```

### Environment variables

The `--run` flag sets specific environment variables that can be useful for your scripts:

- `NODE_RUN_SCRIPT_NAME`: The name of the script being run.
- `NODE_RUN_PACKAGE_JSON_PATH`: The path to the `package.json` file being processed.

### Intentional limitations

The Node.js task runner is intentionally more limited compared to other task runners like `npm run` or `yarn run`. It focuses on performance and simplicity, omitting features like running `pre` or `post` scripts. This makes it suitable for straightforward tasks but may not cover all use cases.
