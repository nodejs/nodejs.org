# User Journey

These diagnostics guides were created by the [Diagnostics Working Group][]
and the [Node.js Website Team][] with the objective of providing guidance
when diagnosing an issue in a user's application.

The documentation project is organized based on user journey. Those journeys
are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures that a user can follow to
root-cause their issues.
