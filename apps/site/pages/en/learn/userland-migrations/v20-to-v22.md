# Nodejs v20 to v22

This page provides a list of codemods to help you migrate your code from Node.js v20 to v22.

## `import-assertions-to-attributes`

During the process of TC39 standardization, the `import assert` feature was introduced to allow importing [JSON modules](https://tc39.es/proposal-json-modules/) but during the during the transition to stage 4, the `assert` keyword was removed and replaced with an `with` attribute on the `import` statement.

So in [node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v22.0.0#other-notable-changes), the `import assert` feature was removed and you need to use the `with` attribute instead.

Also note that the `with` keyword as been introduce in [node.js v18.20](https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/release/v18.20.0#added-support-for-import-attributes) but it was not mandatory until v22.

```bash
npx codemod@latest @nodejs/import-assertions-to-attributes
```

Example:

```js
import jsonData from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
// becomes
import jsonData from './data.json' with { type: 'json' };
```
