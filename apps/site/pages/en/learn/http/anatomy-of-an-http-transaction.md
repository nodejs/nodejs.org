# Anatomy of an HTTP Transaction

The purpose of this guide is to impart a solid understanding of the process of
Node.js HTTP handling. We'll assume that you know, in a general sense, how HTTP
requests work, regardless of language or programming environment. We'll also
assume a bit of familiarity with Node.js [`EventEmitters`][] and [`Streams`][].
If you're not quite familiar with them, it's worth taking a quick read through
the API docs for each of those.

## Create the Server

Any node web server application will at some point have to create a web server
object. This is done by using [`createServer`][].

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  // magic happens here!
});
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

const server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
  // magic happens here!
});
```

The function that's passed in to [`createServer`][] is called once for every
HTTP request that's made against that server, so it's called the request
handler. In fact, the [`Server`][] object returned by [`createServer`][] is an
[`EventEmitter`][], and what we have here is just shorthand for creating a
`server` object and then adding the listener later.

```js
const server = http.createServer();
server.on('request', (request, response) => {
  // the same kind of magic happens here!
});
```

When an HTTP request hits the server, Node calls the request handler function
with a few handy objects for dealing with the transaction, `request` and
`response`. We'll get to those shortly.

In order to actually serve requests, the [`listen`][] method needs to be called
on the `server` object. In most cases, all you'll need to pass to `listen` is
the port number you want the server to listen on. There are some other options
too, so consult the [API reference][].

## Method, URL and Headers

When handling a request, the first thing you'll probably want to do is look at
the method and URL, so that appropriate actions can be taken. Node.js makes this
relatively painless by putting handy properties onto the `request` object.

```js
const { method, url } = request;
```

> The `request` object is an instance of [`IncomingMessage`][].

The `method` here will always be a normal HTTP method/verb. The `url` is the
full URL without the server, protocol or port. For a typical URL, this means
everything after and including the third forward slash.

Headers are also not far away. They're in their own object on `request` called
`headers`.

```js
const { headers } = request;
const userAgent = headers['user-agent'];
```

It's important to note here that all headers are represented in lower-case only,
regardless of how the client actually sent them. This simplifies the task of
parsing headers for whatever purpose.

If some headers are repeated, then their values are overwritten or joined
together as comma-separated strings, depending on the header. In some cases,
this can be problematic, so [`rawHeaders`][] is also available.

## Request Body

When receiving a `POST` or `PUT` request, the request body might be important to
your application. Getting at the body data is a little more involved than
accessing request headers. The `request` object that's passed in to a handler
implements the [`ReadableStream`][] interface. This stream can be listened to or
piped elsewhere just like any other stream. We can grab the data right out of
the stream by listening to the stream's `'data'` and `'end'` events.

The chunk emitted in each `'data'` event is a [`Buffer`][]. If you know it's
going to be string data, the best thing to do is collect the data in an array,
then at the `'end'`, concatenate and stringify it.

```js
let body = [];
request
  .on('data', chunk => {
    body.push(chunk);
  })
  .on('end', () => {
    body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
    // at this point, `body` has the entire request body stored in it as a string
  });
```

> This may seem a tad tedious, and in many cases, it is. Luckily,
> there are modules like [`concat-stream`][] and [`body`][] on [`npm`][] which can
> help hide away some of this logic. It's important to have a good understanding
> of what's going on before going down that road, and that's why you're here!

## A Quick Thing About Errors

Since the `request` object is a [`ReadableStream`][], it's also an
[`EventEmitter`][] and behaves like one when an error happens.

An error in the `request` stream presents itself by emitting an `'error'` event
on the stream. **If you don't have a listener for that event, the error will be
_thrown_, which could crash your Node.js program.** You should therefore add an
`'error'` listener on your request streams, even if you just log it and
continue on your way. (Though it's probably best to send some kind of HTTP error
response. More on that later.)

```js
request.on('error', err => {
  // This prints the error message and stack trace to `stderr`.
  console.error(err.stack);
});
```

There are other ways of [handling these errors][] such as
other abstractions and tools, but always be aware that errors can and do happen,
and you're going to have to deal with them.

## What We've Got so Far

At this point, we've covered creating a server, and grabbing the method, URL,
headers and body out of requests. When we put that all together, it might look
something like this:

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, method, url } = request;
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('error', err => {
        console.error(err);
      })
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        // At this point, we have the headers, method, url and body, and can now
        // do whatever we need to in order to respond to this request.
      });
  })
  .listen(8080); // Activates this server, listening on port 8080.
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, method, url } = request;
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('error', err => {
        console.error(err);
      })
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        // At this point, we have the headers, method, url and body, and can now
        // do whatever we need to in order to respond to this request.
      });
  })
  .listen(8080); // Activates this server, listening on port 8080.
```

If we run this example, we'll be able to _receive_ requests, but not _respond_
to them. In fact, if you hit this example in a web browser, your request would
time out, as nothing is being sent back to the client.

So far we haven't touched on the `response` object at all, which is an instance
of [`ServerResponse`][], which is a [`WritableStream`][]. It contains many
useful methods for sending data back to the client. We'll cover that next.

## HTTP Status Code

If you don't bother setting it, the HTTP status code on a response will always
be 200. Of course, not every HTTP response warrants this, and at some point
you'll definitely want to send a different status code. To do that, you can set
the `statusCode` property.

```js
response.statusCode = 404; // Tell the client that the resource wasn't found.
```

There are some other shortcuts to this, as we'll see soon.

## Setting Response Headers

Headers are set through a convenient method called [`setHeader`][].

```js
response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
response.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'bacon');
```

When setting the headers on a response, the case is insensitive on their names.
If you set a header repeatedly, the last value you set is the value that gets
sent.

## Explicitly Sending Header Data

The methods of setting the headers and status code that we've already discussed
assume that you're using "implicit headers". This means you're counting on node
to send the headers for you at the correct time before you start sending body
data.

If you want, you can _explicitly_ write the headers to the response stream.
To do this, there's a method called [`writeHead`][], which writes the status
code and the headers to the stream.

```js
response.writeHead(200, {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'X-Powered-By': 'bacon',
});
```

Once you've set the headers (either implicitly or explicitly), you're ready to
start sending response data.

## Sending Response Body

Since the `response` object is a [`WritableStream`][], writing a response body
out to the client is just a matter of using the usual stream methods.

```js
response.write('<html>');
response.write('<body>');
response.write('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
response.write('</body>');
response.write('</html>');
response.end();
```

The `end` function on streams can also take in some optional data to send as the
last bit of data on the stream, so we can simplify the example above as follows.

```js
response.end('<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>');
```

> It's important to set the status and headers _before_ you start
> writing chunks of data to the body. This makes sense, since headers come before
> the body in HTTP responses.

## Another Quick Thing About Errors

The `response` stream can also emit `'error'` events, and at some point you're
going to have to deal with that as well. All of the advice for `request` stream
errors still applies here.

## Put It All Together

Now that we've learned about making HTTP responses, let's put it all together.
Building on the earlier example, we're going to make a server that sends back
all of the data that was sent to us by the user. We'll format that data as JSON
using `JSON.stringify`.

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, method, url } = request;
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('error', err => {
        console.error(err);
      })
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        // BEGINNING OF NEW STUFF

        response.on('error', err => {
          console.error(err);
        });

        response.statusCode = 200;
        response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        // Note: the 2 lines above could be replaced with this next one:
        // response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'})

        const responseBody = { headers, method, url, body };

        response.write(JSON.stringify(responseBody));
        response.end();
        // Note: the 2 lines above could be replaced with this next one:
        // response.end(JSON.stringify(responseBody))

        // END OF NEW STUFF
      });
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    const { headers, method, url } = request;
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('error', err => {
        console.error(err);
      })
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        // BEGINNING OF NEW STUFF

        response.on('error', err => {
          console.error(err);
        });

        response.statusCode = 200;
        response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        // Note: the 2 lines above could be replaced with this next one:
        // response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'})

        const responseBody = { headers, method, url, body };

        response.write(JSON.stringify(responseBody));
        response.end();
        // Note: the 2 lines above could be replaced with this next one:
        // response.end(JSON.stringify(responseBody))

        // END OF NEW STUFF
      });
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

## Echo Server Example

Let's simplify the previous example to make a simple echo server, which just
sends whatever data is received in the request right back in the response. All
we need to do is grab the data from the request stream and write that data to
the response stream, similar to what we did previously.

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        response.end(body);
      });
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    let body = [];
    request
      .on('data', chunk => {
        body.push(chunk);
      })
      .on('end', () => {
        body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
        response.end(body);
      });
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

Now let's tweak this. We want to only send an echo under the following
conditions:

- The request method is POST.
- The URL is `/echo`.

In any other case, we want to simply respond with a 404.

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      let body = [];
      request
        .on('data', chunk => {
          body.push(chunk);
        })
        .on('end', () => {
          body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
          response.end(body);
        });
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      let body = [];
      request
        .on('data', chunk => {
          body.push(chunk);
        })
        .on('end', () => {
          body = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
          response.end(body);
        });
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

> By checking the URL in this way, we're doing a form of "routing".
> Other forms of routing can be as simple as `switch` statements or as complex as

Great! Now let's take a stab at simplifying this. Remember, the `request` object
is a [`ReadableStream`][] and the `response` object is a [`WritableStream`][].
That means we can use [`pipe`][] to direct data from one to the other. That's
exactly what we want for an echo server!

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      request.pipe(response);
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      request.pipe(response);
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

Yay streams!

We're not quite done yet though. As mentioned multiple times in this guide,
errors can and do happen, and we need to deal with them.

To handle errors on the request stream, we'll log the error to `stderr` and send
a 400 status code to indicate a `Bad Request`. In a real-world application,
though, we'd want to inspect the error to figure out what the correct status code
and message would be. As usual with errors, you should consult the
[`Error` documentation][].

On the response, we'll just log the error to `stderr`.

```cjs
const http = require('node:http');

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    request.on('error', err => {
      console.error(err);
      response.statusCode = 400;
      response.end();
    });
    response.on('error', err => {
      console.error(err);
    });
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      request.pipe(response);
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

```mjs
import http from 'node:http';

http
  .createServer((request, response) => {
    request.on('error', err => {
      console.error(err);
      response.statusCode = 400;
      response.end();
    });
    response.on('error', err => {
      console.error(err);
    });
    if (request.method === 'POST' && request.url === '/echo') {
      request.pipe(response);
    } else {
      response.statusCode = 404;
      response.end();
    }
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

We've now covered most of the basics of handling HTTP requests. At this point,
you should be able to:

- Instantiate an HTTP server with a request handler function, and have it listen
  on a port.
- Get headers, URL, method and body data from `request` objects.
- Make routing decisions based on URL and/or other data in `request` objects.
- Send headers, HTTP status codes and body data via `response` objects.
- Pipe data from `request` objects and to `response` objects.
- Handle stream errors in both the `request` and `response` streams.

From these basics, Node.js HTTP servers for many typical use cases can be
constructed. There are plenty of other things these APIs provide, so be sure to
