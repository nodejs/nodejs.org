# The Node.js Event Loop

## What is the Event Loop?

The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O
operations — despite the fact that a single JavaScript thread is used by default — by
offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple
operations executing in the background. When one of these operations
completes, the kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback
may be added to the **poll** queue to eventually be executed. We'll explain
this in further detail later in this topic.

## Event Loop Explained

When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the
provided input script (or drops into the [REPL][], which is not covered in
this document) which may make async API calls, schedule timers, or call
`process.nextTick()`, then begins processing the event loop.

The following diagram shows a simplified overview of the event loop's
order of operations.

> Each box will be referred to as a "phase" of the event loop.

Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks to execute. While each phase is
special in its own way, generally, when the event loop enters a given
phase, it will perform any operations specific to that phase, then
execute callbacks in that phase's queue until the queue has been
exhausted or the maximum number of callbacks has executed. When the
queue has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event
loop will move to the next phase, and so on.

Since any of these operations may schedule _more_ operations and new
events processed in the **poll** phase are queued by the kernel, poll
events can be queued while polling events are being processed. As a
result, long running callbacks can allow the poll phase to run much
longer than a timer's threshold. See the [**timers**](#timers) and
[**poll**](#poll) sections for more details.

## Phases Overview

- **timers**: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()`
  and `setInterval()`.
- **pending callbacks**: executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop
  iteration.
- **idle, prepare**: only used internally.
- **poll**: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost
  all with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers,
  and `setImmediate()`); node will block here when appropriate.
- **check**: `setImmediate()` callbacks are invoked here.
- **close callbacks**: some close callbacks, e.g. `socket.on('close', ...)`.

Between each run of the event loop, Node.js checks if it is waiting for
any asynchronous I/O or timers and shuts down cleanly if there are not
any.

## Phases in Detail

### timers

A timer specifies the **threshold** _after which_ a provided callback
_may be executed_ rather than the **exact** time a person _wants it to
be executed_. Timers callbacks will run as early as they can be
scheduled after the specified amount of time has passed; however,
Operating System scheduling or the running of other callbacks may delay
them.

> Technically, the [**poll** phase](#poll) controls when timers are executed.

For example, say you schedule a timeout to execute after a 100 ms
threshold, then your script starts asynchronously reading a file which
takes 95 ms:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

function someAsyncOperation(callback) {
  // Assume this takes 95ms to complete
  fs.readFile('/path/to/file', callback);
}

const timeoutScheduled = Date.now();

setTimeout(() => {
  const delay = Date.now() - timeoutScheduled;

  console.log(`${delay}ms have passed since I was scheduled`);
}, 100);

// do someAsyncOperation which takes 95 ms to complete
someAsyncOperation(() => {
  const startCallback = Date.now();

  // do something that will take 10ms...
  while (Date.now() - startCallback < 10) {
    // do nothing
  }
});
```

When the event loop enters the **poll** phase, it has an empty queue
(`fs.readFile()` has not completed), so it will wait for the number of ms
remaining until the soonest timer's threshold is reached. While it is
waiting 95 ms pass, `fs.readFile()` finishes reading the file and its
callback which takes 10 ms to complete is added to the **poll** queue and
executed. When the callback finishes, there are no more callbacks in the
queue, so the event loop will see that the threshold of the soonest
timer has been reached then wrap back to the **timers** phase to execute
the timer's callback. In this example, you will see that the total delay
between the timer being scheduled and its callback being executed will
be 105ms.

> (the C library that implements the Node.js
> event loop and all of the asynchronous behaviors of the platform)
> also has a hard maximum (system dependent) before it stops polling for
> more events.

### pending callbacks

This phase executes callbacks for some system operations such as types
of TCP errors. For example if a TCP socket receives `ECONNREFUSED` when
attempting to connect, some \*nix systems want to wait to report the
error. This will be queued to execute in the **pending callbacks** phase.

### poll

The **poll** phase has two main functions:

1. Calculating how long it should block and poll for I/O, then
2. Processing events in the **poll** queue.

When the event loop enters the **poll** phase _and there are no timers
scheduled_, one of two things will happen:

- _If the **poll** queue **is not empty**_, the event loop will iterate
  through its queue of callbacks executing them synchronously until
  either the queue has been exhausted, or the system-dependent hard limit
  is reached.

- _If the **poll** queue **is empty**_, one of two more things will
  happen:
  - If scripts have been scheduled by `setImmediate()`, the event loop
    will end the **poll** phase and continue to the **check** phase to
    execute those scheduled scripts.

  - If scripts **have not** been scheduled by `setImmediate()`, the
    event loop will wait for callbacks to be added to the queue, then
    execute them immediately.

Once the **poll** queue is empty the event loop will check for timers
_whose time thresholds have been reached_. If one or more timers are
ready, the event loop will wrap back to the **timers** phase to execute
those timers' callbacks.

### check

This phase allows the event loop to execute callbacks immediately after the
**poll** phase has completed. If the **poll** phase becomes idle and
scripts have been queued with `setImmediate()`, the event loop may
continue to the **check** phase rather than waiting.

`setImmediate()` is actually a special timer that runs in a separate
phase of the event loop. It uses a libuv API that schedules callbacks to
execute after the **poll** phase has completed.

Generally, as the code is executed, the event loop will eventually hit
the **poll** phase where it will wait for an incoming connection, request,
etc. However, if a callback has been scheduled with `setImmediate()`
and the **poll** phase becomes idle, it will end and continue to the
**check** phase rather than waiting for **poll** events.

### close callbacks

If a socket or handle is closed abruptly (e.g. `socket.destroy()`), the
`'close'` event will be emitted in this phase. Otherwise it will be
emitted via `process.nextTick()`.

## `setImmediate()` vs `setTimeout()`

`setImmediate()` and `setTimeout()` are similar, but behave in different
ways depending on when they are called.

- `setImmediate()` is designed to execute a script once the
  current **poll** phase completes.
- `setTimeout()` schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold
  in ms has elapsed.

The order in which the timers are executed will vary depending on the
context in which they are called. If both are called from within the
main module, then timing will be bound by the performance of the process
(which can be impacted by other applications running on the machine).

For example, if we run the following script which is not within an I/O
cycle (i.e. the main module), the order in which the two timers are
executed is non-deterministic, as it is bound by the performance of the
process:

```js
// timeout_vs_immediate.js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('timeout');
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('immediate');
});
```

```bash
$ node timeout_vs_immediate.js
timeout
immediate

$ node timeout_vs_immediate.js
immediate
timeout
```

However, if you move the two calls within an I/O cycle, the immediate
callback is always executed first:

```js
// timeout_vs_immediate.js
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('timeout');
  }, 0);
  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('immediate');
  });
});
```

```bash
$ node timeout_vs_immediate.js
immediate
timeout

$ node timeout_vs_immediate.js
immediate
timeout
```

The main advantage to using `setImmediate()` over `setTimeout()` is
`setImmediate()` will always be executed before any timers if scheduled
within an I/O cycle, independently of how many timers are present.

## `process.nextTick()`

### Understanding `process.nextTick()`

You may have noticed that `process.nextTick()` was not displayed in the
diagram, even though it's a part of the asynchronous API. This is because
`process.nextTick()` is not technically part of the event loop. Instead,
the `nextTickQueue` will be processed after the current operation is
completed, regardless of the current phase of the event loop. Here,
an _operation_ is defined as a transition from the
underlying C/C++ handler, and handling the JavaScript that needs to be
executed.

Looking back at our diagram, any time you call `process.nextTick()` in a
given phase, all callbacks passed to `process.nextTick()` will be
resolved before the event loop continues. This can create some bad
situations because **it allows you to "starve" your I/O by making
recursive `process.nextTick()` calls**, which prevents the event loop
from reaching the **poll** phase.

### Why would that be allowed?

Why would something like this be included in Node.js? Part of it is a
design philosophy where an API should always be asynchronous even where
it doesn't have to be. Take this code snippet for example:

```js
function apiCall(arg, callback) {
  if (typeof arg !== 'string')
    return process.nextTick(
      callback,
      new TypeError('argument should be string')
    );
}
```

The snippet does an argument check and if it's not correct, it will pass
the error to the callback. The API updated fairly recently to allow
passing arguments to `process.nextTick()` allowing it to take any
arguments passed after the callback to be propagated as the arguments to
the callback so you don't have to nest functions.

What we're doing is passing an error back to the user but only _after_
we have allowed the rest of the user's code to execute. By using
`process.nextTick()` we guarantee that `apiCall()` always runs its
callback _after_ the rest of the user's code and _before_ the event loop
is allowed to proceed. To achieve this, the JS call stack is allowed to
unwind then immediately execute the provided callback which allows a
person to make recursive calls to `process.nextTick()` without reaching a
`RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded from v8`.

This philosophy can lead to some potentially problematic situations.
Take this snippet for example:

```js
let bar = null;

// this has an asynchronous signature, but calls callback synchronously
function someAsyncApiCall(callback) {
  callback();
}

// the callback is called before `someAsyncApiCall` completes.
someAsyncApiCall(() => {
  // since someAsyncApiCall hasn't completed, bar hasn't been assigned any value
  console.log('bar', bar); // undefined
});

bar = 1;
```

The user defines `someAsyncApiCall()` to have an asynchronous signature,
but it actually operates synchronously. When it is called, the callback
provided to `someAsyncApiCall()` is called in the same phase of the
event loop because `someAsyncApiCall()` doesn't actually do anything
asynchronously. As a result, the callback tries to reference `bar` even
though it may not have that variable in scope yet, because the script has not
been able to run to completion.

By placing the callback in a `process.nextTick()`, the script still has the
ability to run to completion, allowing all the variables, functions,
etc., to be initialized prior to the callback being called. It also has
the advantage of not allowing the event loop to continue. It may be
useful for the user to be alerted to an error before the event loop is
allowed to continue. Here is the previous example using `process.nextTick()`:

```js
let bar = null;

function someAsyncApiCall(callback) {
  process.nextTick(callback);
}

someAsyncApiCall(() => {
  console.log('bar', bar); // 1
});

bar = 1;
```

Here's another real world example:

```js
const server = net.createServer(() => {}).listen(8080);

server.on('listening', () => {});
```

When only a port is passed, the port is bound immediately. So, the
`'listening'` callback could be called immediately. The problem is that the
`.on('listening')` callback will not have been set by that time.

To get around this, the `'listening'` event is queued in a `nextTick()`
to allow the script to run to completion. This allows the user to set
any event handlers they want.

## `process.nextTick()` vs `setImmediate()`

We have two calls that are similar as far as users are concerned, but
their names are confusing.

- `process.nextTick()` fires immediately on the same phase
- `setImmediate()` fires on the following iteration or 'tick' of the
  event loop

In essence, the names should be swapped. `process.nextTick()` fires more
immediately than `setImmediate()`, but this is an artifact of the past
which is unlikely to change. Making this switch would break a large
percentage of the packages on npm. Every day more new modules are being
added, which means every day we wait, more potential breakages occur.
While they are confusing, the names themselves won't change.

> We recommend developers use `setImmediate()` in all cases because it's
> easier to reason about.

## Why use `process.nextTick()`?

There are two main reasons:

1. Allow users to handle errors, cleanup any then unneeded resources, or
   perhaps try the request again before the event loop continues.

2. At times it's necessary to allow a callback to run after the call
   stack has unwound but before the event loop continues.

One example is to match the user's expectations. Simple example:

```js
const server = net.createServer();
server.on('connection', conn => {});

server.listen(8080);
server.on('listening', () => {});
```

Say that `listen()` is run at the beginning of the event loop, but the
listening callback is placed in a `setImmediate()`. Unless a
hostname is passed, binding to the port will happen immediately. For
the event loop to proceed, it must hit the **poll** phase, which means
there is a non-zero chance that a connection could have been received
allowing the connection event to be fired before the listening event.

Another example is extending an `EventEmitter` and emitting an
event from within the constructor:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.emit('event');
  }
}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
```

You can't emit an event from the constructor immediately
because the script will not have processed to the point where the user
assigns a callback to that event. So, within the constructor itself,
you can use `process.nextTick()` to set a callback to emit the event
after the constructor has finished, which provides the expected results:

```js
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super();

    // use nextTick to emit the event once a handler is assigned
    process.nextTick(() => {
      this.emit('event');
    });
  }
}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!');
});
```
