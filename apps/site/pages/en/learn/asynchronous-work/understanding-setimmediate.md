# Understanding setImmediate()

When you want to execute some piece of code asynchronously, but as soon as possible, one option is to use the `setImmediate()` function provided by Node.js:

```js
setImmediate(() => {
  // run something
});
```

Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that's executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

How is `setImmediate()` different from `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` (passing a 0ms timeout), and from `process.nextTick()` and `Promise.then()`?

A function passed to `process.nextTick()` is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. This means it will always execute before `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`.

A `setTimeout()` callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to `setImmediate()`. The execution order will depend on various factors, but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.

A `process.nextTick` callback is added to `process.nextTick queue`. A `Promise.then()` callback is added to `promises microtask queue`. A `setTimeout`, `setImmediate` callback is added to `macrotask queue`.

Event loop executes tasks in `process.nextTick queue` first, and then executes `promises microtask queue`, and then executes `macrotask queue`.

Here is an example to show the order between `setImmediate()`, `process.nextTick()` and `Promise.then()`:

```js
const baz = () => console.log('baz');
const foo = () => console.log('foo');
const zoo = () => console.log('zoo');

const start = () => {
  console.log('start');
  setImmediate(baz);
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve('bar');
  }).then(resolve => {
    console.log(resolve);
    process.nextTick(zoo);
  });
  process.nextTick(foo);
};

start();

// start foo bar zoo baz
```

This code will first call `start()`, then call `foo()` in `process.nextTick queue`. After that, it will handle `promises microtask queue`, which prints `bar` and adds `zoo()` in `process.nextTick queue` at the same time. Then it will call `zoo()` which has just been added. In the end, the `baz()` in `macrotask queue` is called.

The principle aforementioned holds true in CommonJS cases, but keep in mind in ES Modules, e.g. `mjs` files, the execution order will be different:

```js
// start bar foo zoo baz
```

This is because the ES Module being loaded is wrapped as an asynchronous operation, and thus the entire script is actually already in the `promises microtask queue`. So when the promise is immediately resolved, its callback is appended to the `microtask` queue. Node.js will attempt to clear the queue until moving to any other queue, and hence you will see it outputs `bar` first.
