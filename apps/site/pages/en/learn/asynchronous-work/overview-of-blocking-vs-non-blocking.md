# Overview of Blocking vs Non-Blocking

This overview covers the difference between **blocking** and **non-blocking**
calls in Node.js. This overview will refer to the event loop and libuv but no
prior knowledge of those topics is required. Readers are assumed to have a
basic understanding of the JavaScript language and Node.js [callback pattern](/learn/asynchronous-work/javascript-asynchronous-programming-and-callbacks).

> "I/O" refers primarily to interaction with the system's disk and
> network supported by [libuv](https://libuv.org/).

## Blocking

**Blocking** is when the execution of additional JavaScript in the Node.js
process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. This happens
because the event loop is unable to continue running JavaScript while a
**blocking** operation is occurring.

In Node.js, JavaScript that exhibits poor performance due to being CPU intensive
rather than waiting on a non-JavaScript operation, such as I/O, isn't typically
referred to as **blocking**. Synchronous methods in the Node.js standard library
that use libuv are the most commonly used **blocking** operations. Native
modules may also have **blocking** methods.

All of the I/O methods in the Node.js standard library provide asynchronous
versions, which are **non-blocking**, and accept callback functions. Some
methods also have **blocking** counterparts, which have names that end with
`Sync`.

## Comparing Code

**Blocking** methods execute **synchronously** and **non-blocking** methods
execute **asynchronously**.

Using the File System module as an example, this is a **synchronous** file read:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read
```

And here is an equivalent **asynchronous** example:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
});
```

The first example appears simpler than the second but has the disadvantage of
the second line **blocking** the execution of any additional JavaScript until
the entire file is read. Note that in the synchronous version if an error is
thrown it will need to be caught or the process will crash. In the asynchronous
version, it is up to the author to decide whether an error should throw as
shown.

Let's expand our example a little bit:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read
console.log(data);
moreWork(); // will run after console.log
```

And here is a similar, but not equivalent asynchronous example:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  console.log(data);
});
moreWork(); // will run before console.log
```

In the first example above, `console.log` will be called before `moreWork()`. In
the second example `fs.readFile()` is **non-blocking** so JavaScript execution
can continue and `moreWork()` will be called first. The ability to run
`moreWork()` without waiting for the file read to complete is a key design
choice that allows for higher throughput.

## Concurrency and Throughput

JavaScript execution in Node.js is single threaded, so concurrency refers to the
event loop's capacity to execute JavaScript callback functions after completing
other work. Any code that is expected to run in a concurrent manner must allow
the event loop to continue running as non-JavaScript operations, like I/O, are
occurring.

As an example, let's consider a case where each request to a web server takes
50ms to complete and 45ms of that 50ms is database I/O that can be done
asynchronously. Choosing **non-blocking** asynchronous operations frees up that
45ms per request to handle other requests. This is a significant difference in
capacity just by choosing to use **non-blocking** methods instead of
**blocking** methods.

The event loop is different than models in many other languages where additional
threads may be created to handle concurrent work.

## Dangers of Mixing Blocking and Non-Blocking Code

There are some patterns that should be avoided when dealing with I/O. Let's look
at an example:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }

  console.log(data);
});
fs.unlinkSync('/file.md');
```

In the above example, `fs.unlinkSync()` is likely to be run before
`fs.readFile()`, which would delete `file.md` before it is actually read. A
better way to write this, which is completely **non-blocking** and guaranteed to
execute in the correct order is:

```js
const fs = require('node:fs');

fs.readFile('/file.md', (readFileErr, data) => {
  if (readFileErr) {
    throw readFileErr;
  }

  console.log(data);

  fs.unlink('/file.md', unlinkErr => {
    if (unlinkErr) {
      throw unlinkErr;
    }
  });
});
```

The above places a **non-blocking** call to `fs.unlink()` within the callback of
`fs.readFile()` which guarantees the correct order of operations.
