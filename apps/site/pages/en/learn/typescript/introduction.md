# Introduction to TypeScript

## What is TypeScript

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)** is an open-source language maintained and developed by Microsoft. It's loved and used by a lot of software developers around the world.

Basically, TypeScript add adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor or in your CI/CD pipeline, and write more maintainable code.

We can talk about other TypeScript benefits later, let's see some examples now!

## First TypeScript code

Take a look at this code snippet and then we can unpack it together:

<!--
  Maintainers note: this code is duplicated in the next article, please keep them in sync
-->

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function isAdult(user: User): boolean {
  return user.age >= 18;
}

const justine = {
  name: 'Justine',
  age: 23,
} satisfies User;

const isJustineAnAdult = isAdult(justine);
```

The first part (with the `type` keyword) is responsible for declaring our custom object type representing users. Later we utilize this newly created type to create function `isAdult` that accepts one argument of type `User` and returns `boolean`. After this, we create `justine`, our example data that can be used for calling the previously defined function. Finally, we create a new variable with information on whether `justine` is an adult.

There are additional things about this example that you should know. Firstly, if we would not comply with declared types, TypeScript would alarm us that something is wrong and prevent misuse. Secondly, not everything must be typed explicitly - TypeScript is very smart and can infer types for us. For example, variable `isJustineAnAdult` is of type `boolean` even if we didn't type it explicitly or `justine` would be valid argument for our function even though we didn't declare this variable as of `User` type.

## How to run TypeScript code

Okay, so we have some TypeScript code. Now how do we run it?
There are few possible ways to run TypeScript code, we will cover all of them in the next articles.
