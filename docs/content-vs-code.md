## Content vs. Code

The **Website Team** (@nodejs/nodejs-website) is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the website.

The content of the website comes from Node.js core collaborators, in particular, from a variety of teams and [working groups](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/WORKING_GROUPS.md#current-working-groups).

The Website team defers to these teams and WGs on matters of content. In other words, the Website team is not an **editorial** team except when no team or Working Group has taken responsibility for a content area, meaning we are the default editors for that content. In this case, the Website team will suggest editorial decisions. It is important to mention that there is no current formal process for ownership of content areas. Hence, generally speaking any core collaborator is invited to contribute content to the website.

Some sections are implicitly assigned to teams based on a general consensus of what certain sections are about. An example of this policy playing out is Node.js releases blog posts. The Release WG has ownership of such content and it is free to publish it on the website. Some WGs might also have direct write access to this repository, meaning that (by using good judgement) they can approve their own Pull Requests.

Note that The Website team may only review content for correct usage of this repository's tooling and structure and will not make editorial decisions (except in the case of content areas that have no team or WG ownership).

#### Summary

The Website Team is responsible for creating, crafting and maintaining the Node.js Website, but we delegate the content creation to the Node.js Core Collaborators. The Website Team might suggest or add content, but it is not responsible for the content itself.
