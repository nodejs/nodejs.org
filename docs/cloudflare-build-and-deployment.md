# Cloudflare Build and Deployment

The Node.js Website can be built using the [OpenNext Cloudflare adapter](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare). Such build generates a [Cloudflare Worker](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/workers/) that can be deployed on the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) network.

## Configurations

There are two key configuration files related to Cloudflare deployments:

### Wrangler Configuration

This file defines the settings for the Cloudflare Worker, which serves the website.

For more details, refer to the [Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

Key configurations include:

- `main`: Points to the worker generated by the OpenNext adapter.
- `account_id`: Specifies the Cloudflare account ID. This is not required for local previews but is necessary for deployments. You can obtain an account ID for free by signing up at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
  - This is currently set to `fb4a2d0f103c6ff38854ac69eb709272`, which is the ID of a Cloudflare account controlled by Node.js, and used for testing.
- `build`: Defines the build command to generate the Node.js filesystem polyfills required for the application to run on Cloudflare Workers. This uses the [`@flarelabs/wrangler-build-time-fs-assets-polyfilling`](https://github.com/flarelabs-net/wrangler-build-time-fs-assets-polyfilling) package.
- `alias`: Maps aliases for the Node.js filesystem polyfills generated during the build process.
- `r2_buckets`: Contains a single R2 binding definition for `NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET`. This is used to implement the Next.js incremental cache.
  - This is currently set up to a R2 bucket in the aforementioned Cloudflare testing account.
- `durable_objects`: Contains a single DurableObject binding definition for `NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE`. This is used to implement the Open-next cache queue.

### OpenNext Configuration

This is the configuration for the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter.

For more details, refer to the [official OpenNext documentation](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/get-started#4-add-an-open-nextconfigts-file).

### Skew Protection

While Vercel offers [version skew protection](https://vercel.com/docs/skew-protection) out of the box, such mechanism is not present on the platform level in the Cloudflare network.

Therefore, the OpenNext adapter provides its [own implementation](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/skew).

The OpenNext skew protection requires the following environment variables to be set in the Wrangler configuration file:

- `CF_WORKER_NAME`
  - The name of the worker (the same as `name`)
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`
  - The ID of the Cloudflare account (the same as `account_id`)
- `CF_PREVIEW_DOMAIN`
  - The preview domain for the worker. For Node.js, this is `nodejsorg`.

Additionally, when deploying, an extra `CF_WORKERS_SCRIPTS_API_TOKEN` environment variable needs to be set to an API token that has the `Workers Scripts:Read` permission available on the Worker's account.

### Image loader

When deployed on the Cloudflare network a custom image loader is required. We set such loader in the Next.js config file when the `OPEN_NEXT_CLOUDFLARE` environment variable is set (which indicates that we're building the application for the Cloudflare deployment).

The custom loader can be found at [`site/cloudflare/image-loader.ts`](../apps/site/cloudflare/image-loader.ts).

For more details on this see: https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/integrate-with-frameworks/#global-loader

## Scripts

Preview and deployment of the website targeting the Cloudflare network is implemented via the following two commands:

- `pnpm cloudflare:preview` builds the website using the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter and runs the website locally in a server simulating the Cloudflare hosting (using the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/))
- `pnpm cloudflare:deploy` builds the website using the OpenNext Cloudflare adapter and deploys the website to the Cloudflare network (using the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/))
