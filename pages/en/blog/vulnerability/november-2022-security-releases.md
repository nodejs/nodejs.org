## _(Update 04-November-2022)_ Security releases available

Updates are now available for v14,x, v16.x, v18.x and v19.x Node.js
release lines for the following issues.

## X.509 Email Address 4-byte Buffer Overflow (High) (CVE-2022-3602)

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs
after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a
CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address
to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer
overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or
potentially remote code execution.

Impacts:

- All versions of the v18.x and v19.x releases lines.

## X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow (High) (CVE-2022-3786)

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue
certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate
to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.` character
(decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash
(causing a denial of service).

In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
client authentication and a malicious client connects.

OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 are vulnerable to this issue.

Impacts:

- All versions of the v18.x and v19.x releases lines.

## DNS rebinding in --inspect via invalid octal IP address (Medium) (CVE-2022-43548)

The Node.js rebinding protector for --inspect still allows invalid IP address,
specifically, the octal format. An example of an octal IP address is 1.09.0.0,
the 09 octet is invalid because 9 is not a number in the base 8 number system.
Browsers such as Firefox (tested on latest version m105) will still attempt to
resolve this invalid octal address via DNS. When combined with an active
--inspect session, such as when using VSCode, an attacker can perform DNS
rebinding and execute arbitrary code

Thank you to @haxatron1 for reporting this vulnerability.

Impacts:

- All versions of the v14.x, v16.x, v18.x, and v19.x releases lines.

## _(Update 03-Nov-2022)_ Security Release target November 4th

It's taking us a bit longer than originally expected and the Node.js Security Releases
will be available on, or shortly after, Friday, November 4th, 2022.

# Summary

The Node.js project will release new versions of the 14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 19.x
releases lines on or shortly after Thursday, November 3, 2022 in order to address:

- One medium severity issues.
- Two high severity issues that affect OpenSSL as per [secadv/20221101.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221101.txt)

These security releases are driven by the OpenSSL security release as announced in [OpenSSL November Security Release](/blog/vulnerability/openssl-november-2022/) as well as an additional vulnerability that affects all supported release lines.

## Impact

The 19.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one medium severity issue and two high severity issues.

The 18.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one medium severity issue and two high severity issues.

The 16.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one medium severity issue.

The 14.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one medium severity issue.

## Release timing

Releases will be available on, or shortly after, Thursday, November 3rd, 2022.
