# _(Update 16-February-2023)_ Security releases available

Updates are now available for the v19.x, v18.x, v16.x, and v14.x Node.js release lines for the
following issues.

## OpenSSL Security updates

This security release includes OpenSSL security updates as outlined in the recent
[OpenSSL security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).

Impacts:

- All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## Node.js Permissions policies can be bypassed via process.mainModule (High) ([CVE-2023-23918](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23918))

It was possible to bypass [Permissions](https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html) and access non authorized modules by using process.mainModule.require(). This only affects users who had enabled the experimental permissions option with `--experimental-policy`.

Thank you, to [@goums](https://github.com/goums) for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

- All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## Node.js OpenSSL error handling issues in nodejs crypto library (Medium) ([CVE-2023-23919](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23919))

In some cases Node.js did does not clear the OpenSSL error stack after operations that may set it. This may lead to false positive errors during subsequent cryptographic operations that happen to be on the same thread. This in turn could be used to cause a denial of service.

Thank you, to Morgan Jones and Ryan Dorrity from Viasat Secure Mobile for reporting and discovering this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

- Versions of < 19.2.0 and lower of the 19.x release line and all versions of the 18.x, and 16.x release lines.

## Fetch API in Node.js did not protect against CRLF injection in host headers (Medium) ([CVE-2023-23936](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23936))

The [fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) in Node.js did not prevent
CRLF injection in the 'host' header potentially allowing attacks such as HTTP response splitting
and HTTP header injection.

Thank you, to Zhipeng Zhang ([@timon8](https://hackerone.com/timon8)) for reporting this vulnerability and thank you Robert Nagy for fixing it.

Impacts:

- All versions of the 19.x, 18.x and 16.x release lines.

## Regular Expression Denial of Service in Headers in Node.js fetch API(Low) ([CVE-2023-24807](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-24807))

The Headers.set() and Headers.append() methods in the
[fetch API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) in Node.js were vulnerable to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks.

Thank you, to Carter Snook for reporting this vulnerability and thank you Rich Trott for fixing it.

Impacts:

- All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, and 16.x release lines.

## Node.js insecure loading of ICU data through ICU_DATA environment variable (Low) ([CVE-2023-23920](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23920))

Node.js would search and potentially load ICU data when running with elevated priviledges. Node.js
was modified to build with `ICU_NO_USER_DATA_OVERRIDE` to avoid this.

Thank you, to Ben Noordhuis for reporting this vulnerability and thank you [Rafael Gonzaga](https://github.com/RafaelGSS) for fixing it.

Impacts:

- All versions of the 19.x, 18.x, 16.x, and 14.x release lines.

## npm update for Node.js 14

This security release also includes an npm update for Node.js 14 to address a number
of CVEs which either do not affect Node.js or are low severity in the context of Node.js. You
can get more details for the individual CVEs in
[nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments).

Impacts:

- All versions 14.x release lines.
