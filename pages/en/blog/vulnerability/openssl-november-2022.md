### Summary

The Node.js project may be releasing new versions across all of its supported
release lines in the first week of November to incorporate upstream patches
from OpenSSL. Please read on for full details.

### OpenSSL

The OpenSSL project
[announced](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-October/000238.html)
will release OpenSSL 3.0.7 on the 1th of
November 2022 between 1300-1700 UTC. The release will fix security defects on which
the _highest_ severity issue is [HIGH](https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html#issue-severity).

Node.js v17.x, v18.x, and v19.x use OpenSSL v3.

Node.js v18.x and v19.x will be updated to address this issue.

Support for Node.js v17.x ended in June 2022. It will not be updated. Please migrate to a supported version of Node.js.

Node.js 14.x and v16.x are not affected by this OpenSSL update.

At this stage, due to embargo, the exact nature of these defects is uncertain
as well as the impact they will have on Node.js users.

After assessing the impact on Node.js, it will be decided whether the issues
fixed require immediate security releases of Node.js, or whether they can be
included in the normally scheduled updates.

Please monitor the **nodejs-sec** Google Group for updates, including a
decision within 24 hours after the OpenSSL release regarding release timing,
and full details of the defects upon eventual release:
