### Summary

The Node.js project may be releasing new versions across all of its supported
release lines late this week to incorporate upstream patches from OpenSSL.
Please read on for full details.

### OpenSSL

The OpenSSL project
[announced](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-March/000216.html)
this week that they will be releasing versions 3.0.2 and 1.1.1n on the 15th of
March 2022 between 1300-1700 UTC. The releases will fix two security defects that are
labelled as "HIGH" severity under their
[security policy](https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html).

Node.js v12.x, v14.x and v16.x use OpenSSL v1.1.1 and Node.js v17.x uses OpenSSL
v3. Therefore all active release lines are impacted by this update.

At this stage, due to embargo, the exact nature of these defects is uncertain
as well as the impact they will have on Node.js users.

After assessing the impact on Node.js, it will be decided whether the issues
fixed require immediate security releases of Node.js, or whether they can be
included in the normally scheduled updates.

Please monitor the **nodejs-sec** Google Group for updates, including a
decision within 24 hours after the OpenSSL release regarding release timing,
and full details of the defects upon eventual release:
