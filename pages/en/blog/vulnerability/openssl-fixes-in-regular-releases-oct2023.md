- [OpenSSL 3.0.12](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2023-October/000282.html)

is:

### POLY1305 MAC implementation corrupts XMM registers on Windows (CVE-2023-4807) - Low

Node.js is affected by this vulnerability. The CVE-2023-4807
affects Windows users, and the vulnerability is rated as LOW by the OpenSSL
Security Team.

### Incorrect cipher key & IV length processing (CVE-2023-5363) - Moderate

Node.js doesn't make use or export `EVP_EncryptInit_ex2()`, `EVP_DecryptInit_ex2()` or
`EVP_CipherInit_ex2()` functions. Node.js is not affected.

Users who call the affected OpenSSL functions through other means,
such as through native addons, can dynamically link against a patched version of OpenSSL
until new releases of Node.js are available.
