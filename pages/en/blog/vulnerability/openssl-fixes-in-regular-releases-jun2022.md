## Summary

The vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL Security releases of Jun 21 2022 do not affect any active Node.js release lines.

## Analysis

Our assessment of the [security advisory](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2022-June/000228.html) is:

### The `c_rehash` script allows command injection (CVE-2022-2068)

Node.js doesn't use or ship the `c_rehash` script. Therefore, Node.js is not affected
