### Node v6.0.0 (Current) Release

[Node v6.0.0 (Current)](/blog/release/v6.0.0/). Complete changelog from previous releases can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

See [Breaking changes between v5 and v6](https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki/Breaking-changes-between-v5-and-v6) for more information.

You may have noticed that the v6 release uses the label `Current` instead of `Stable`. This name change has been made in order to better differentiate the Long Term Support releases from the current active development branches. We
will be using the `Current` label from here-on instead of `Stable`.

### World’s Fastest Growing Open Source Platform Pushes Out New Release

Performance improvements are key in this latest release with one of the most significant improvements coming from module loading, which is currently four times faster than Node.js version 4 (Node.js v4). This will help developers dramatically decrease the startup time of large applications for the best productivity in development cycles and more seamless experience with end users. In addition, Node.js v6 comes equipped with v8 JavaScript engine 5.0, which has improved ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) support. Ninety-three percent of ES6 features are also now supported in the Node.js v6 release, up from 56 percent for Node.js v5 and 50 percent for Node.js v4. Key features from ES6 include: default and rest parameters, destructuring, class and super keywords.

See /blog/announcements/v6-release/ for more information.
