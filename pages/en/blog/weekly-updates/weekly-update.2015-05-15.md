# io.js News

We are happy to announce this news, **"io.js decides to join the Node Foundation"**. And our organization name will be renamed `nodejs`.

As a first step, we will move from `iojs` organization to `nodejs` organization and will converge `joyent/node` gradually. We will continue to release `io.js` until the convergence have done.

If you would like to see the convergence plan in detail, please check it at [jasnell repo](https://github.com/jasnell/dev-policy/blob/master/convergence.md). When you would like to ask questions, feel free to ask [@Fishrock123](mailto:fishrock123@rocketmail.com). The discussion log is [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/1664).
