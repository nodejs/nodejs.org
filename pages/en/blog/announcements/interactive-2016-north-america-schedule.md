> IBM, Netflix, Microsoft, and leading community experts to showcase the current and future of Node.js

**SAN FRANCISCO, September 12, 2016** — [The Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/), a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced the keynotes and agenda for Node.js Interactive North America, November 29 - December 2, 2016, in Austin, TX. The event attracts enterprise users, developers, and community stakeholders, providing them with the tools and training they need to optimize the Node.js platform.

With almost 5 million users a month and adoption across numerous industries, Node.js is a universal platform for web applications, IoT, enterprise application development, and microservice architectures. Its liberal contribution policies have also allowed the platform to increase the number of contributors working on the project by a sustained 100% year-over-year growth for the last several years.

Node.js Interactive offers a unique mix of skill-building and knowledge-sharing sessions, panels, and workshops to help developers accelerate their use of Node.js. It is the only vendor-neutral event that offers the community better insight into Node.js and its working groups, combined with best practices and instruction on how to improve performance, debugging, security, and tooling for mainstream enterprise users.

The event is designed to appeal to both experienced and new developers and architects with a NodeSchool event happening during the conferences. Additionally, NodeTogether, a beginner tutorial event that also aims to improve diversity within the Node.js community, is holding a special teachers training at the event.

“Node.js has clearly become a high-priority platform for digital transformation. Node.js Interactive will have a roster of expert technical and community speakers who will discuss the future of Node.js and new growth in areas like artificial intelligence, cloud native architectures, container-packaged applications and more,” said Mikeal Rogers, community manager of the Node.js Foundation.
