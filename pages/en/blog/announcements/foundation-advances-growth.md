> Node.js Platform Stronger Than Ever with New Node.js Foundation Members,
> Community Contributions, and 100 Percent Year-Over-Year User Growth

**NODE.JS INTERACTIVE 2015, PORTLAND, OR.** — [The Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/), a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today is announcing major community, code and membership growth, adoption statistics of the technology at large, and the Foundation’s new incubation program.

The Node.js Foundation was founded in 2015 to accelerate the development of Node.js and support the large ecosystem that it encompasses through open governance. As part of this mission, the Foundation announced its first incubation project libuv. Libuv is a software library that provides asynchronous event notification and improves the Node.js programming experience. The project is both critical to Node.js and already widely used, making it a natural fit for the Foundation. Under the Foundation's umbrella, it will receive additional support and mentorship.

The first Node.js Interactive event unites more than 700 developers, engineers, system architects, DevOps professionals and users representing a wide range of projects, products and companies in Portland, Ore. Node.js Interactive brings together a broad range of speakers to help experienced and novice Node.js users alike learn tips, best practices, new skills, as well as gain insight into future developments for the technology. With Node.js being used in 98% of the Fortune 500 companies regularly, the event will also highlight the maturation of the technology within enterprises.

Attendees have the opportunity to see and learn more about how organizations like Capital One, GoDaddy, Intel, NodeSource, npm and Uber are using Node.js to meet their innovation needs. Attendees are also getting a first look at Node.js advancements announced and demoed this week including:

- JOYENT: Joyent is announcing the 2016 Node.js Innovation Program, which provides Node.js expertise, marketing support and free cloud or on-premise infrastructure to start-ups and teams within larger enterprises that are driving innovation powered by Node.js. The 2015 program included [bitHound](https://www.bithound.io/), who will speak at Node.js Interactive about innovative approaches to identifying risk and priorities in dependencies and code. More info can be found [here](https://www.joyent.com/innovation).

  Joyent also released a new Node.js, Docker and NoSQL reference [architecture](https://www.joyent.com/blog/how-to-dockerize-a-complete-application) that enables microservices in seconds. To learn more, the company will be demoing this at booth number 7.

- IBM is featuring multiple Node.js based solutions for: a complete API lifecycle via StrongLoop Arc and Loopback.io; real-time location tracking in Node using Cloudant® data services; how to write Node applications against Apache Spark; and end-to-end mobile applications using IBM MobileFirst -- all running on Bluemix®, IBM's Cloud Platform.

- INTEL: A leader in the Internet of Things, Intel will be demoing a SmartHouse at booth number 0013. Based on the [IoTivity](https://www.iotivity.org/) open source project, which is sponsored by the [Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC)](http://openinterconnect.org/), the SmartHouse includes a home gateway from MinnowBoard Max client, three Edison controlled LEDs, fan, motion sensor, and smoke detector. Intel developed Node.js binding for IoTivity to power the demo with everything being controlled from a WebGL 3D virtual house interface.

- NEARFORM: nearForm is holding a Node Expert Clinic for attendees who are looking for advice on Node.js adoption or struggling with any existing problems. Individuals will be connected to experts including Matteo Collina, Colin Ihrig, Wyatt Preul and Peter Elger for 30 minute sessions which can be arranged at the conference.

  In addition, the company is sharing real customer successes and adoption statistics of Node.js at large. The company gathered the data from 100 of their Node customers across the globe. The leading industries in implementation and adoption of Node.js include enterprise software companies and media companies. Financial, payment, travel, e-commerce and IoT tie for third in industries that are leading in both adoption and implementation.

  Startups are leading the way in adding Node.js into their strategy, but in 2013 and 2014 larger incumbents started to transition their stacks with Node.js as a core technology, notable names include PayPal, Condé Nast, and Costa. In terms of startup saturation:

  - 25% of developers at growth-stage companies in enterprise software are using Node.js;
  - 25% of developers at FinTech startups are using Node.js;
  - Healthcare startups are using Node.js in a significant way - an average of 33% of developers are using Node.js with the primary use-case to enable rapid-innovation;
  - 48% of developers are using Node.js at IoT companies;
  - 80% of developers at education startups are using the technology.

- NODESOURCE: The company will showcase [N|Solid](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid) for Enterprise-grade Node.js platform. It extends the capability of Node.js to provide increased developer productivity, protection of critical applications, and peak application performance.

  The company will also have [free upgrade tools](https://marketing.nodesource.com/acton/fs/blocks/showLandingPage/a/15680/p/p-001f/t/page/fm/4) available to help developers implement the latest Long Term Support version, v4. This version is essential for enterprises and companies using Node.js in more complex environments as it is the most stable and highly security code from the platform.

- SYNCHRO LABS: Silver Node.js Interactive sponsor Synchro Labs announced the launch of Synchro platform, a new tool that allows enterprise developers to create high quality, high performance, cross-platform native mobile applications using the Node.js framework. The company is demoing the new platform at the conference booth 2. More information on the recent announcement [here](https://synchro.io/launch).

### Community and Code Growth

Since the independent Node.js Foundation launched earlier this year, development progress continues to accelerate with dramatic increases in contributions to the project. In the past eight months, the community has grown from 8 to more than 400 contributors, with first-time contributors as high as 63 percent per month. There are more than 3 million active users of Node.js, which has increased 100% year over year.

Currently the core Node.js repository includes 52 committers, while there’s been more than 709 contributors over time. Node.js core had 77 active contributors in October alone, with 46 of those being first-time contributors. More than 400 developers have commit rights to some part of the Node.js project currently. The community is focused on creating a new type of open source contribution philosophy called participatory governance, which liberalizes contribution policies and provides direct ownership to contributors.

In addition, the Foundation announced three new Silver members to the team, Apigee, RisingStack, and Yahoo. You can find details of the new membership here.
