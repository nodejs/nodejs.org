> Inaugural Conference to Advance the Use of Node.js Within Backend, Frontend, IoT Applications

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20, 2015 – [The Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/), a community-led and industry-backed consortium to advance the development of the Node.js platform, today announced initial programming for [Node.js Interactive](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive). This inaugural event, which is being led by the newly formed Node.js Foundation in cooperation with the Linux Foundation, will be held December 8-9, 2015, in Portland, Ore.

Node.js has become ubiquitous in almost every ecosystem in technology and is consistently being used more in mainstream enterprises. To continue to evolve the platform, Node.js Interactive brings together a wide range of community, projects, products and companies to create an educational and collaborative space. With more than 700 attendees expected, Node.js Interactive will provide a way to network with other developers and engineers within this diverse community.

Node.js Interactive will also focus on three tracks: Frontend, Backend and the Internet of Things (IoT); talks for each track were selected in collaboration with track chairs [Jessica Lord](https://github.com/jlord/) (Frontend), [C J Silvero](https://github.com/ceejbot) (Backend) and [Kassandra Perch](https://github.com/nodebotanist) (IoT).
