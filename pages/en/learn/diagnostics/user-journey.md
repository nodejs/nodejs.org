# User Journey

These diagnostics guides were created by the [Diagnostics Working Group][] with the
objective of providing guidance when diagnosing an issue in a user's
application.

The documentation project is organized based on user journey. Those journeys
are a coherent set of step-by-step procedures that a user can follow to
root-cause their issues.
