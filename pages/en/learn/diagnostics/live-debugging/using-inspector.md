# Using Inspector

In a local environment, we usually speak about live debugging where we attach a
debugger to our application and we add breakpoints to suspend the program
execution. Then we step through the code paths and inspect our heap over the
different steps. Using the live debugger in production is usually not an option
as we have limited access to the machine and we cannot interrupt the execution
of the application as it handles a business-critical workload.
