# 協力者サミットformat@@0

Node.js's Collaborator Summit is an un-conference for bringing current and
potential contributors together to discuss Node.js with lively collaboration,
education, and knowledge sharing. Committees and working groups come together
twice per year to make important decisions while also being able to work on some
exciting efforts they want to push forward in-person.

## 誰が出席しますか？

Anyone is welcome to attend Collab Summit. During the
summit, leaders will help onboard new contributors to groups they'd love to help
prior to integrating them into the working sessions.

これは、コミュニティ内で何が起きているかを学び、
あなたが持っているスキルを身につけたいと思うスキルを身につける機会です。

Working groups will put together a schedule so that people can
familiarize themselves before folks get onsite, having the general collaborator
discussions, and then dive into breakout sessions.

We'd love to see you at Collab Summit! Check out the [Summit repo](https://github.com/nodejs/summit)
for upcoming and past Collab Summits and have a look at the
[issues filed](https://github.com/nodejs/summit/issues) that share what
individual working groups and committees are looking to discuss in-person.
