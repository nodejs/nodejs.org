# This action automates the synchronization of our crowdin translations, so that a human does not need to kick it off from the crowdin UI
# It also formats incoming content because it is often not adherent to our rules post-translation.

# See translations-upload.yml for automation to upload our source content
# See translations-pr-lint.yml for quality control we conduct on ingress of new translations.
