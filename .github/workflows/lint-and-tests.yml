# Only selected Actions are allowed within this repository. Please refer to (https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/settings/actions)
# for the full list of available actions. If you want to add a new one, please reach out a maintainer with Admin permissions.
# REVIEWERS, please always double-check security practices before merging a PR that contains workflow changes!!
# AUTHORS, please only use actions with explicit SHA references, and avoid using `@master` or `@main` references or `@version` tags.

name: Linting and Tests

# This workflow should run either on `merge_group`, `pull_request`, or `push` events
# since we want to run lint checks against any changes on pull requests, or the final patch on merge groups
# or if direct pushes happen to main (or when changes in general land on the `main` (default) branch)
# Note that the reason why we run this on pushes against `main` is that on rare cases, maintainers might do direct pushes against `main`

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  merge_group:

# The permissions specified below apply to workflows triggered by `merge_group`, `push`, and `pull_request` events that originate from the same repository (non-fork).
# However, workflows triggered by `pull_request` events from forked repositories are treated differently for security reasons:
# - These workflows **do not** have access to any secrets configured in the repository.
# - They are also **not granted any permissions** to perform actions on the base repository.
#
# This is a deliberate security restriction designed to prevent potential abuse through malicious pull requests from forks.
# For a deeper explanation and best practices for securing your GitHub Actions workflows, particularly against so-called "pwn requests",
# refer to https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
