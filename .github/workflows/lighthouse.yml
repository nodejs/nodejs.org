# Security Notes
# This workflow uses `pull_request_target`, so will run against all PRs automatically (without approval), be careful with allowing any user-provided code to be run here
# Only selected Actions are allowed within this repository. Please refer to (https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/settings/actions)
# for the full list of available actions. If you want to add a new one, please reach out a maintainer with Admin permissions.
# REVIEWERS, please always double-check security practices before merging a PR that contains Workflow changes!!
# AUTHORS, please only use actions with explicit SHA references, and avoid using `@master` or `@main` references or `@version` tags.
# MERGE QUEUE NOTE: This Workflow does not run on `merge_group` trigger, as this Workflow is not required for Merge Queue's
