      # We don't generate non-translated pages. So if a certain page on /en/ exists
      # but not on /de/ or any other language, it will 404. This is handled on nginx level
      # Prior to this migration Metalsmith would copy the English version of a page to all
      # the non-translated pages. "Fooling" the 404 by basically adding i18n context with
      # an untranslated page. This would be very exhaustive with Next.js on SCG mode
      # but it's something we want to do once we decide upon using Next.js on SSR mode or
      # if we decide upon using Vercel's infrastructure as generating a copy of every English page
      # on the file system is very resource exhaustive.
